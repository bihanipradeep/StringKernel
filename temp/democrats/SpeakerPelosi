President Trump has shown his true colors: walking away from coronavirus relief negotiations and refusing to give real help to poor children, the unemployed, and America's hard working families. https://t.co/gic4yuVsTB
We must ensure that Americans have access to the testing, tracing and treatment that they need to make it through this crisis – especially communities of color, which have been so disproportionately affected by this pandemic. #MSNBCLive https://t.co/VMwDUS1nsV
We must crush this coronavirus — and protect the Affordable Care Act to ensure Americans have access to the health care they need now more than ever. #FamiliesFirst @FaceTheNation https://t.co/MZxYhJC2v4
.@NewDemCoalition Chairman @RepDerekKilmer perfectly illustrates the community-level impact of this health &amp; economic crisis. We have a duty to deliver relief for our fellow Americans. #HeroesAct https://t.co/JdYp3r34zG
Today, thanks to the leadership of @RepJayapal and @HouseDemWomen, the House called on @DHSgov to end the infliction of unwanted, life-altering &amp; inhumane medical procedures on immigrant women. https://t.co/9H5duGkYIB
Today, Republicans blocked the House from delivering urgent relief for tens of thousands of airline workers standing on the brink of having their livelihoods ripped away.\n \nEither the @HouseGOP isn't serious about meeting the challenge facing our country, or they do not care.
Honored to join my @HouseDemWomen colleagues tonight to pay tribute to the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her memory inspires us to continue the fight for justice &amp; equality for all. https://t.co/pf8MGWs9rk
Thank you to @NitaLowey for shepherding this Continuing Resolution through the Congress, averting a catastrophic shutdown in the middle of the ongoing pandemic. With my signature, this agreement, which will keep government open through December 11, goes to the President's desk. https://t.co/Ey3daEHLt5
The House will be proceeding with our vote tonight on the updated #HeroesAct in order to formalize our proffer to Republicans in the negotiations to address the health and economic catastrophe in our country.
Today, @stevenmnuchin1 and I had an extensive conversation and we found areas where we are seeking further clarification. Our conversation will continue.
This Supreme Court nomination fight is about preserving Americans' right to pre-existing condition protections. It is about protecting women's health care. It is about defending each and every benefit of the Affordable Care Act. @Morning_Joe https://t.co/jR43yoXxm2
Thanks to the leadership of Rep. @RepDebHaaland &amp; @NormaJTorres, we are taking an important step toward justice for survivors and addressing the horrific #MMIW crisis. With my signature, the Not Invisible Act and Savanna's Act both head to the President's desk. https://t.co/cMAiiuqflo
We take an oath to protect and defend. The public has a right to know who the President owes hundreds of millions of dollars to. This is a question of national security. @mitchellreports https://t.co/jBQC533FJs
It is a sign of President Trump's disdain for America's working families that he has spent years abusing the tax code while passing a GOP Tax Scam for the rich that gives 83 percent of the benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent. https://t.co/FXfxlc7wfY
The President's resistance to science, facts and the reality on the ground has made it all the more necessary for us to take action to fight this virus. #CNNSOTU https://t.co/E5LGHpzJdr

For four years, President Trump has tried to crush the Affordable Care Act. With his Supreme Court nominee, he is threatening the destruction of every benefit and protection of the ACA, including life-saving protections for 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Today, we gathered to honor the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice's Ginsburg's towering intellect, tenacity and devotion to our nation's founding ideals of equality and justice inspired millions around the world. Now, we must continue her work. https://t.co/ajXjQM9a5w

That's why the House passed the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act this summer. We owe it to Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Philando Castile and so many others to finally bring an end to police brutality.
Breonna Taylor should be alive today. She should be living and laughing and loving. Instead, her family is left continuing the search for justice. Today's charging decision holds no one accountable for her death.
President Trump has trampled on American democracy. \n \nBut House Democrats will protect and strengthen it for generations to come.\n \nThe #ProtectingOurDemocracy Act will prevent presidential abuses, restore our system of checks &amp; balances and protect our elections. https://t.co/57bDbtiqPY

President Trump's contempt for science, governance &amp; the American people's health has led to an historic national tragedy. Republicans must accept the gravity of this crisis &amp; vote on the science-based strategy in the #HeroesAct, which passed the House more than four months ago.
More than 200,000 men, women and children have lost their lives to this coronavirus in the United States.\n\nOur hearts break for them and their loved ones.\n\nThe pain is made worse by the simple fact that it didn't have to be this way.
Read my full statement here: https://t.co/I8tekH9IvQ
Nearly 200,000 Americans have died. Almost seven million Americans have been infected. The sudden removal of CDC guidelines on airborne coronavirus spread is the latest sign of the Trump Admin's broken response to this crisis, which continues to cost American lives.
President Trump and his henchmen have threatened to not accept the results of the November election. We have a responsibility to do all we can to protect the integrity of our democracy. #ThisWeek https://t.co/oIosGCb6Yo

Americans' lives &amp; livelihoods depend on Republicans abandoning their obsession with doing as little as possible while the coronavirus rages through our nation.\n\nRead my full statement with @SenSchumer: https://t.co/gqzvU4FHOL
It's encouraging to see that the President is now calling on Republicans to "go for the much higher numbers" after months of Senate GOP efforts to shortchange Americans' needs. We look forward hearing from his negotiators that they will finally meet us halfway. #FamiliesFirstNow

The main way we can open our economy &amp; open our schools is to crush the virus. Instead, President Trump is focused on trying to crush the Affordable Care Act at the time when we need it most. #MSNBCLive https://t.co/vjKthimufK
Four years of President Trump caving to Big Pharma have culminated in this sham. Trump's latest empty announcement is an insult to all the seniors and families who are still waiting for real action to lower their prescription drug costs. https://t.co/xeIIALyxzp

The sad state of America's coronavirus response today is the result of President Trump's failure to lead these past months and Mitch McConnell's one-sided pause. We can't waste a day. The Senate must pass the #HeroesAct or the situation will worsen. https://t.co/xlq49ZtDZQ

We can and we must make progress to save Black Lives and we can start by enacting the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act, which the House passed more than eight weeks ago. It's time for the Senate to act.
The prayers of Americans nationwide are with Jacob Blake as he fights for his life following yesterday's outrageous shooting in Kenosha, WI. We owe it to Jacob, his children, and all Black Americans to bring an end to racial injustice and police brutality.
Millions of children are hungry. Millions of Americans are facing eviction. Democrats are fighting for real solutions for all Americans. That's why, 100 days ago, we passed the #HeroesAct to support frontline heroes and hardworking families nationwide. #CNNSOTU https://t.co/QfSqXTe9ED
Republicans are complicit in President Trump's efforts to undermine the integrity of our elections. #CNNSOTU https://t.co/njIXskkB9k

Democrats remain committed to protecting the @USPS, and will vote this Saturday on @RepMaloney's Delivering for America Act, providing $25 billion in support of the Postal Service as the USPS Board of Governors recommended, 100 percent appointed by Trump.
This, taken with his unwillingness to plan for adequate worker overtime, directly jeopardizes the election and threatens to disenfranchise voters in communities of color, while also slowing delivery of medicines to veterans. https://t.co/uN0ETY2kSK
Earlier today, I spoke with Postmaster General DeJoy regarding his alleged pause in operational changes. During our conversation, he admitted he has no intention of replacing the sorting machines, blue mailboxes and other infrastructure that have been removed.
Postmaster General DeJoy's announcement today only halts a limited number of his changes, does not reverse damage already done, and alone is not enough to ensure voters will not be disenfranchised by the President this fall. #DontMessWithUSPS #DeadlineWH https://t.co/YmS4pe12wh

Today, we mark #BlackWomensEqualPayDay — the day in 2020 when Black women's pay finally catches up with white men's for 2019. We all must do our part every single day to shrink this gap. The House passed the #PaycheckFairness Act over a year ago. What's your excuse, @senategop?

Democrats have compromised. Repeatedly, we have made clear to the Trump Admin that we are willing to come down $1 trillion if they will come up $1 trillion. However, it is clear that the Admin still does not grasp the magnitude of the problems that American families are facing.
Right now, children in America are going hungry – and yet Republicans refuse to deliver the unemployment insurance &amp; nutrition assistance their families need. Grateful to all who are fasting today &amp; otherwise calling for Republicans to work with Democrats to #SaveThe600!
Republicans refused to take action to feed hungry children nationwide during this pandemic – but they did make sure to give business a massive tax break for corporate lunches. #TheReidOut https://t.co/sHLmkP16u8

After 10 weeks of Senate Republicans' unilateral "pause" on responding to the coronavirus, it remains unclear whether they will release their plan today – even as working families struggle to make rent, children go hungry and unemployment is expiring.

At every turn, President Trump has made matters worse for our country as we seek to fight the coronavirus. Instead of denying facts and trying to rush our children back to school before it is safe, he should be supporting the policies found in the #HeroesAct. @FaceTheNation https://t.co/sXSqCpFjje
Each and every one of us has a duty to stand up to hate wherever it appears. The KZV Armenian School is a part of the beautiful fabric of our San Francisco family. The hateful defacing of this place of community &amp; learning is a disgrace.

First Amendment speech should never be met with one-sided violence from federal agents acting as Trump's secret police, especially when unidentified. This is disgraceful behavior we would expect from a banana republic — not the government of the United States.
Unidentified stormtroopers. Unmarked cars. Kidnapping protesters and causing severe injuries in response to graffiti.\n\nThese are not the actions of a democratic republic.\n\n@DHSgov's actions in Portland undermine its mission.\n\nTrump &amp; his stormtroopers must be stopped.

The President's dereliction of duty is dangerous. The Republican Senate must join the House in passing the #HeroesAct and calling on President Trump to use executive action for good.
Months into the crisis, there is still not enough personal protective equipment &amp; other medical supplies available to communities nationwide. But @realDonaldTrump refuses to fully employ the Defense Production Act to make that equipment available.
Observing the President's behavior, it's clear he is like a man who refuses to ask for directions.\n\nAll the answers are there. The scientists are clear: testing, tracing, isolation, and masks are critical.\n\nAnd yet the President takes the wrong path.
We can't solve the COVID-19 problem without the tools to do so. Every day President Trump fails to utilize the Defense Production Act &amp; Senate Republicans block the #HeroesAct, they are denying communities the tools they need to fight this pandemic.
Nearly 50,000 Americans have lost their lives to COVID-19 since the House passage of the #HeroesAct two months ago today. Our communities are demanding action. It's time for the Republican Senate to stop blocking life-saving progress. https://t.co/1qCPecrlEO

The President's official withdrawal of the U.S. from the World Health Organization is an act of true senselessness as @WHO coordinates the global fight against COVID-19. With millions of lives at risk, the President is crippling the international effort to defeat the virus.

This weekend, our San Francisco family was once again struck by the tragic loss of a child to gun violence. No parent — no family — should have to feel this pain. Last year, the House passed H.R. 8 to #EndGunViolence. The Senate must take swift action. https://t.co/5lTfM8QhZD
Happy Fourth of July! https://t.co/ywgQiJven2
Generations of Americans have &amp; will continue to have the courage to fight for a more perfect union. Our military servicemembers have the courage to sacrifice their lives in defense of these principles — let us have the courage to work together to make those ideals a reality.
On July 4, 1776, our Founders had the courage to declare that all are created equal and to fight a revolution for the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
The hearts of Americans nationwide are with Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen's family as they mourn her tragic loss. We stand with them as they demand answers, and are grateful for @RepSylviaGarcia's efforts to deliver justice &amp; protect all women serving our country.

Last year, House Democrats renewed our commitment to progress by introducing and passing the American Dream &amp; Promise Act, which would provide more than 2 million Dreamers a shot at the American Dream. It's time for Senate Republicans to stop stonewalling &amp; stand with Dreamers.
Eight years after DACA began, it continues to give #Dreamers the peace-of-mind to fully participate in their communities. Democrats will never stop fighting to ensure DACA recipients are protected from the Trump Admin's shameful attacks.
The Supreme Court's ruling today secures critical protections for LGBTQ Americans across the country – but it's far from the end. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans must stop holding up the #EqualityAct and finally vote for progress. #SitRoom https://t.co/zWad2qUFc0

If President Trump is serious about confronting China's human rights abuses, he must work with Congress to craft an effective, robust strategy. His vague suggestions for confronting China's actions are nothing new &amp; do not articulate a real or serious strategy.
The President's withdrawal from @WHO as it leads the fight against COVID-19 is an act of extraordinary senselessness. Again and again, he blames others and refuses to take responsibility. Only with a coordinated global response will we defeat this virus.
The House &amp; Senate firmly stood with our students &amp; veterans to reject the Admin's cruel decision to turn its back on thousands defrauded by predatory colleges. It is sad that the President rejected the will of the Congress and the Country with his veto. https://t.co/lrcQb0dSyZ
President Trump's failure to provide consistent and stable leadership has brought us to where we are today. Chairman @FrankPallone is leading the fight to implement a national COVID-19 testing program by enacting the #HeroesAct. We must act swiftly. https://t.co/JBDACSGWi2
It's no secret that we need to expand testing nationwide. Instead of refusing to face reality, the GOP Senate must step up and pass the #HeroesAct in order to expand testing &amp; support our heroic frontline workers. #AMR https://t.co/xQcGRwOHtZ

Allowing the spread of disinformation is extremely dangerous. Yet still, the President encourages Facebook &amp; others to continue to exploit and profit off falsehoods – while directing the federal government to dismantle efforts to help users distinguish fact from fiction.
If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere.
The Administration should work with Congress on an appropriate response which considers all tools available, including visa limitations and economic penalties.
This excessive law brazenly accelerates Beijing's years-long assault on Hong Kong's political and economic freedoms, coming after the threat of the extradition bill and of police brutality last fall. All freedom-loving people must come together to condemn this law.
The so-called "national security framework" – Beijing's latest move against Hong Kong – threatens the death of the ‘one country, two systems' principle. https://t.co/rDNOkNj8wh
Newly-released unemployment data shows that 1-in-4 American workers have filed for unemployment during this public health crisis. Now more than ever, the Senate must pass the House-passed #HeroesAct and put #FamiliesFirst. https://t.co/ZjTB9fuvCm
I will be speaking with reporters regarding the ongoing efforts to put #FamiliesFirst in our COVID-19 crisis response at 10:45 am ET at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTune in here: https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
The best thing we can do to stimulate our economy is to put money into the pockets of the American people. #FamiliesFirst https://t.co/wo8zwmSWnJ
We have a responsibility to defeat COVID-19. It's time for President Trump to stop making excuses and take responsibility. #FamiliesFirst https://t.co/XXeYAhYy9v
Leader McConnell thinks Congress should pause it's response to this crisis.\n\nLast time I checked, the virus isn't taking a pause. Neither should we.\n\nThe Senate must pass the #HeroesAct immediately. #FamiliesFirst https://t.co/2DFjDHEbLc
At a time when fear &amp; bigotry led many to ignore the human toll of the AIDS epidemic, Larry Kramer was a relentless, dissatisfied voice for justice. Through his activism, Larry demanded attention and saved lives. His vision &amp; leadership will continue to inspire us all.
Tragically, 100,000 people across America have lost their lives to COVID-19. Meanwhile, there is still no strong, nationwide plan to expand testing like the one in the #HeroesAct.\n\nThe Senate must pass it immediately. https://t.co/GLTbm8UqHt
As we learn that 100,000 lives have been lost to COVID-19, it is clearer than ever that we must enact the strong testing plan passed as part of the #HeroesAct. #FamiliesFirst\n\nTune in at 2:30 pm ET to learn more: https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
Voting at home shouldn't be a question of politics. It's a health issue. No American should have to choose between their protecting their health and exercising their right to vote. #inners https://t.co/SxgOvhgwg4
We are eternally grateful for the courage &amp; service of the men and women who gave their last full measure of devotion for our country. On this #MemorialDay, we honor their memory and #RememberTheFallen. @WWIIMemorial https://t.co/lmckZus03b
Read my joint statement with @SenSchumer, Rep. @FrankPallone and Sen. @PattyMurray here: https://t.co/4lY3wCNvYJ
.@SenateMajLdr must stop obstructing the House-passed #HeroesAct, which would deliver a clear strategy and $75 billion for the testing and contact tracing necessary to stop the spread of this vicious virus.
To reopen our economy safely, we need testing to be free, accurate, reliable and accompanied by tools like contact tracing so we can slow the spread of the virus and prevent outbreaks.
The Administration's disappointing report confirms that President Trump's national testing strategy is to deny the truth that there aren't enough tests and supplies, reject responsibility and dump the burden onto the states.
After six months and nearly 100,000 lives lost, the Trump Administration still does not have a serious plan for increasing testing to stop the spread of the virus.
Today, our nation faces a challenge equal to any in our history. We reaffirm our commitment to caring for and supporting our military families, veterans, wounded warriors, active duty troops, as well as the National Guard &amp; Reservists on the frontlines of this crisis.
Each #MemorialDay, all Americans unite in honoring the patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. These brave men and women in uniform safeguarded our most cherished values and helped build a brighter future for all Americans. https://t.co/nLWKSg8Iy6 https://t.co/x3ftUDnHXL
-Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost\n-Almost 40 million are jobless\n-1 in 5 children are going hungry\n\nBut the Trump White House is obsessed with a capital gains tax break for the wealthiest few. \n\nDemocrats passed the #HeroesAct For The People — now the GOP Senate must join us. https://t.co/k4lyrYntZQ
The losses suffered by our American family have been staggering — every story heartbreaking in its own way. As we near 100,000 lives lost, we pray for those who have passed, their loved ones and all who are working to save lives &amp; protect our communities. https://t.co/vaBsirLu5c

Withdrawing from the Open Skies Treaty without a replacement further undermines America's credibility in the global community and makes Americans less safe. https://t.co/wir9s8at1f
Harvey Milk was a man of extraordinary vision and tenacity, who challenged us all to fight for a better future for the LGBTQ community &amp; all Americans. His relentless optimism remains an inspiration as we confront this unprecedented crisis. #HarveyMilkDay https://t.co/mXtpKtSdYu https://t.co/BCKLmyQ5wR
We will soon cross the awful threshold of 100,000 Americans lost to the coronavirus.\n\nFlying the flags at half staff, as @SenSchumer &amp; I proposed in our letter to the President this morning, is an important show of national grief. \n\nLet us honor their memory &amp; act to save lives. https://t.co/lSdJEhnrZM
Make no mistake: voting at home is not only a matter of protecting our democracy – it's also a question of protecting Americans' health. #HeroesAct #LastWord https://t.co/m3r6lDgRdq
Women were not *given* the right to vote.\n\nThey won it for themselves through sheer force of will.\n\nGenerations of women &amp; girls fought to be heard.\n\nToday, we honor their leadership as we mark 101 years since the House passed the 19th Amendment.
Beijing's announcement of yet another attempt to bring an end to the "one country, two systems" framework in #HongKong is deeply alarming. Attempting to circumvent the HK legislature shows a complete disrespect for the rule of law.
We cannot allow the President to distract us from our duty to deliver crucial support for American families and frontline workers. #HeroesAct #LastWord https://t.co/LL5G2Db8L3
Ensuring Americans are able to vote at home is a crucial step in protecting the health of people in communities across the country. We have a responsibility to ensure our democratic elections do not become a casualty of this crisis. #HeroesAct https://t.co/v7t4LafEkb

The Justice Department's continued delay is part of a pattern of the Administration hiding the truth from the public. The American people deserve the truth.
The House's long-standing right to obtain grand jury information pursuant to the House's impeachment power has now been upheld by the lower courts twice. These rulings are supported by decades of precedent and should be permitted to proceed.

Instead of holding a vote on The #HeroesAct, Senate Republicans are engaging in a clear act of political retribution designed to help the President keep his job.\n\nThe Senate must stop playing along with the President's dangerous tactics &amp; take steps to save lives and livelihoods.

We still do not know the full scale of the tragedy gripping our nation. That is why testing &amp; tracing are at the core of The #HeroesAct. The Senate must pass this legislation to ensure we have the information needed to fight back against COVID-19. #FamiliesFirst #DeadlineWH https://t.co/uhUd8PE7Bp
Proud to send @RepSusieLee's bipartisan resolution to the President's desk and protect tens of thousands of defrauded students, many of whom are hurting now more than ever, by blocking Devos's harmful student borrower defense rule. @realDonaldTrump must sign it without delay. https://t.co/nTptfApZr6

News reports that the President may have fired the State Dept IG in response to him nearing completion of an investigation into the approval of billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia are deeply concerning.

Inspectors General are at the core of the fight to stop waste, fraud &amp; abuse in our government. The President's pattern of retaliation against these committed public servants is disgraceful &amp; may be unlawful. @FaceTheNation https://t.co/Ei1gtoR4x5
Testing. Treatment. Isolation.\n\nScience shows us that is the path to overcoming this virus.\n\nAnd it is that plan which is at the heart of the #HeroesAct.\n\nThe Senate must take up this crucial legislation immediately. #FamiliesFirst @FaceTheNation https://t.co/9tS0M4b3EK

The pillars of the #HeroesAct are based on the bipartisan bills already passed by the Congress to combat the coronavirus. We must continue to put #FamiliesFirst. https://t.co/qV9KCgixxD
The #HeroesAct is based on a simple premise: that it's not enough just to expand testing, tracing and treatment. We must ensure all Americans have access. #FamiliesFirst https://t.co/qhCbXeqUjs

Republicans have stood in the way of expanding SNAP benefits in the last three coronavirus relief bills. As mothers report that 1 in 5 children do not have enough to eat, we must work together to expand our support for our most vulnerable. #FamiliesFirst @FCPwithGreta https://t.co/zulFQ6doii
The sooner we identify the scale of the problem, the sooner we can open our economy. We must expand testing without delay. #FamiliesFirst @FCPwithGreta https://t.co/VciVAsWjWt

There are certain things that are urgent. Republicans' hope for a capital gains tax cut for the wealthiest Americans – when nearly one-fifth of mothers with young children say their kids are not getting enough to eat – is not one of them. #FamiliesFirst @BloombergTV https://t.co/PTs7ShlmvH

The Trump Administration must not take away health care from tens of millions of Americans in the middle of a pandemic. The President should end his lawsuit seeking to dismantle the ACA and the crucial pre-existing condition protections it includes. https://t.co/cPY2S8B0bG
Congress cannot allow their reward for this inspiring show of expertise to be a furlough or a pink slip. The best way to #ThankATeacher is to ensure they and countless other workers in our communities have the support they need to continue their vital work. RT if you agree!
Over the last two months, teachers nationwide have achieved the impossible: rewriting lesson plans in a matter of hours, rapidly mastering new technology, and devising innovative ways to keep America's students engaged at a distance.
As far as I'm concerned, every day should be #TeacherAppreciationDay. Their miraculous work is invaluable and their impact on our children unmistakable – even without a national crisis complicating their efforts.
