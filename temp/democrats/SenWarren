Last night, @JimmyKimmel asked me what I thought of the Supreme Court hearings. I told him: this Republican effort to rip away health care should not be taking place. https://t.co/1Gu2DHTudp
I wrote a bill before Trump was sworn in to enforce the clause banning the President from taking foreign payments. I expanded it in my bill to #EndCorruptionNow. If the Court won't uphold the ban on these conflicts, Congress should do it and pass my bill. https://t.co/e9NAtITUC6
Yet another example of why Trump &amp; Republican senators are working hard to steal this Supreme Court seat: they want to hand the Court to extremists &amp; undermine our democracy. The judiciary absolutely should not approve the Trump administration's efforts to corrupt the Census. https://t.co/r7JkRA91pG
Last week, I released a report with @SenWhitehouse and others on the orchestrated right-wing effort to capture our courts for billionaires and giant corporations. Take a look at #WhatsAtStake if Barrett tips the courts against workers and consumers. https://t.co/PAhuANVu1w https://t.co/qFTf9g9Oi5
Amy Coney Barrett signed an ad calling Roe v Wade \"barbaric\" and spoke to anti-abortion groups. Now she won't say whether Roe was wrongly decided. Don't be fooled: Barrett has an agenda to get on the Court to overturn reproductive rights.
I'm going to keep saying this until I'm blue in the face: Presidents should not be able to own companies, hotels, and golf clubs on the side. It's corruption, plain and simple, and my bill to #EndCorruptionNow would end this bribery invitation. https://t.co/2p9Uwm7l2X
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a personal hero for me and millions of other women. Read my new @RollingStone piece on why we must honor Ruth's "fervent wish" and stop Donald Trump and the Senate Republicans from stealing this Supreme Court seat. https://t.co/3W0TIZfmrc
#IndigenousPeoplesDay is an opportunity for our country to celebrate the rich cultures, valuable contributions, &amp; remarkable resilience of Native communities.

If today's Supreme Court hearings to steal a Supreme Court seat make you furious, get in the fight and make your voice heard. The power isn't just in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room right now – the power is with you.
This absurd hearing is happening today because Amy Coney Barrett is the last hope for a desperate, undemocratically overrepresented party trying to cling to power just a little longer, &amp; impose the agenda of billionaires, giant corporations, &amp; far-right extremists on our country.
Most Americans don't want the Supreme Court to take away abortion rights. Most Americans don't want the Supreme Court to rip away health care from millions of people. And most Americans believe that the next President should be filling this Supreme Court seat.
Senate Republicans know that Amy Coney Barrett will gut health care. That's why they're racing the clock to get her on the bench before the Supreme Court hears the case on November 10th that could deal the death blow to the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/EmSvrFVZLg
Senate Republicans know that Amy Coney Barrett is dedicated to overturning Roe v. Wade. That's why they're rushing this hearing without forcing Barrett to disclose her full anti-choice background, like her talks and support of anti-abortion groups. https://t.co/xSdsezYdjb
Today's sham hearing – on a holiday, 22 days from Election Day, during a COVID-19 outbreak in the Judiciary Committee with a likely-exposed Chairman who won't get tested – shows just how far the GOP will go to steal another Supreme Court seat &amp; hand our courts over to extremists.
If Trump rams through a Supreme Court nominee to repeal the ACA, the millions of Americans who have contracted COVID this year will have a new pre-existing condition that could raise their rates and jeopardize their health care. That's a fact. https://t.co/FczR8HaDV7
The American people deserve transparency into the health of our "Too Big to Fail" banks. And they deserve a real COVID-19 relief bill to help struggling families and small businesses, and stabilize our economy to prevent another Wall Street crash and taxpayer bailout.
Big banks take stress tests to make sure they won't bring down our economy. It's mind-blowing that the Fed is still allowing these banks to pay dividends to rich shareholders without a full picture of their readiness for a long recession.
In 2008, Wall St's recklessness brought our economy to its knees &amp; taxpayers got stuck with the bill. Fast forward 12 years to a recession, &amp; the Fed says some of those same big banks' planning for another crash \"has not been thoughtful." Are you kidding? https://t.co/0uuUcHgp7M
Too many Americans with disabilities already face barriers to quality health care. If Trump steals a Supreme Court seat to repeal the Affordable Care Act, programs and protections that help people live full, independent lives will be at risk. https://t.co/tOlsI4Z3pt

Amy Coney Barrett is the ticket for a desperate right-wing party that wants to hold onto power a little longer to impose its extremist agenda on the entire country. They nominated her to undermine health care and turn back the clock on reproductive rights. https://t.co/PYaprwUwLB

I don't have a problem with our tax-dodging President getting great medical care. I do have a problem with him trying to ram through a Supreme Court nominee who will overturn the ACA during the COVID crisis so struggling Americans can't get health care too. https://t.co/Bi3PdpJ8IO
Trump &amp; his right-wing buddies are desperate to overturn the ACA &amp; turn back the clock on reproductive rights. Amy Coney Barrett is their ideal nominee. Read my @TheCut piece on why we can't sit back while abortion &amp; birth control access are on the line. https://t.co/zEE1LqHG0V
My office contacted @ICEgov yesterday to find out whether its personnel were involved in this incident. I'm still waiting for an answer.

People are struggling with addiction, and opioid overdoses have increased during COVID-19. President Trump should be working to fight this public health crisis – not ramming through a Supreme Court nominee to rip away mental health services by repealing the ACA.
4 years ago I passed a bipartisan bill to let patients partially fill opioid prescriptions so they don't pile up in medicine cabinets for family or friends to misuse. We want to know why @DEAHQ is still dragging its feet to fully implement this policy. https://t.co/kiZ4TfbGVU

In the middle of the worst pandemic in a century, Trump won't help people get the relief they need – but he will ram through an illegitimate Supreme Court nominee to rip away Americans' health care. So much for the art of the deal. This is despicable. https://t.co/08kKOQfhER
I'm sure that everyone who is sick, out of work, going hungry, losing their homes, shuttering small businesses, or struggling in a zillion other ways during this pandemic is thrilled that you are hard at work to steal a Supreme Court seat for rich and powerful extremists. https://t.co/NtPkz0hrvo
Fed Chair Powell is absolutely correct: helping families, small businesses, and state and local governments is critical for our fragile economy. Trump, McConnell, and the Senate Republicans need to stop standing in the way of our economic recovery.  https://t.co/UOQF2qQnQZ
Too many people have already been exposed to COVID-19 from the GOP outbreak. Every senator who tested positive must follow CDC isolation guidelines.

The new jobs report shows just how awful the crisis has been for women. A huge number of moms are leaving the workforce entirely. We must save our child care system, fund our schools, &amp; contain COVID-19 so we don't lose a whole generation of working women. https://t.co/cJLOiCvQKr
Trump, McConnell, and Supreme Court Justices have access to some of the best medical care in the world. Many Americans don't – and people will die if they repeal the ACA. It is reckless and wrong to ram through a nominee hand-picked to rip away health care during a pandemic.
Cancer survivors, high-risk seniors, and mamas of babies with complex medical needs are all holding their breath during this pandemic, praying they won't get sick. The last thing anyone should have to worry about now is a last-ditch power grab threatening their health care.
Repealing the ACA would harm Americans' health while simultaneously making it harder to contain this pandemic. Fewer people could decide to be tested or treated for COVID-19 if they know a positive diagnosis in their record could jeopardize their future ability to get covered.
COVID-19 has also triggered depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders for many people across the country. The ACA drastically expanded mental health coverage and access to treatment – protections that could disappear overnight if Trump and the Supreme Court repeal it.
We don't yet know all of the long-term risks of COVID-19, but we can't ignore the evidence of heart and lung damage, strokes, and other chronic conditions. Without the ACA, COVID is another way that insurance companies could reject people or send their costs through the roof.
One week after Election Day, the Supreme Court will hear the case that could deal the death blow to the ACA. We could soon be back to the days of pre-existing conditions, annual limits, and lifetime caps. 23 million Americans would lose their health care. https://t.co/3cE2RtadJL
We all remember when insurance companies could discriminate against people with asthma, diabetes or cancer. Now if Trump and Amy Coney Barrett have their way, millions could lose health care over a new pre-existing condition: COVID-19. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/EUpgliIqep

I've lost track of all the ways @WellsFargo has failed its customers. Each time they swear they'll change, but don't. The @FederalReserve shouldn't even consider lifting Wells Fargo's growth cap until they prove they've made the structural reforms needed to fix these problems.
Involuntarily placing borrowers into forbearance can haunt @WellsFargo customers for years. They can have problems refinancing their mortgage or resolving bankruptcy cases. And it could damage their credit scores and make it harder for them to access credit or even find a job.
Wells Fargo is still fundamentally broken. The bank didn't just accidentally place a few non-delinquent borrowers into mortgage forbearance without consent during this pandemic – it was a systemic practice caused by @WellsFargo's gross mismanagement. https://t.co/HBwnFUHw1v

This disregard for human life is staggering. Big meatpackers told the White House that health and safety rules shouldn't apply to them. The Trump administration has coddled them at every turn, prioritizing corporate profit at any cost over protecting people's lives.
Thousands of workers got COVID-19 at meatpacking plants because companies refused to take actions that could have slowed the spread and saved lives. That's a fact. Now they're denying workers' comp for medical care and lost wages. Are you kidding me, JBS? https://t.co/XgXIoXekpF

Trump wanted the real estate market to crash in 2007 because he "always made more money in bad markets than good." He drooled over the idea of people losing their homes so he could scoop on property on the cheap. Trump doesn't care who gets hurt, so long as it helps Donald Trump.
I thought maybe Trump hid his taxes because he was just a lousy businessman and didn't want everyone to know he wasn't as rich as he claimed to be. For our country's sake, I wish that were the whole story – because Trump's financial debt &amp; entanglements put our country at risk.
Donald Trump's businesses rely on roads and bridges the rest of us paid for. They rely on workers the rest of us paid to educate. They rely on a world-class military the rest of us pay for to keep us safe. Why are working families paying Donald Trump's fair share?
We now know the President owes a lot of people a lot of money. He may be vulnerable to financial blackmail from a hostile foreign power and God knows what else. That's why Presidents must release their tax returns. I've got a bill for that. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/QiZNlbPoLM
It shouldn't take a court ruling or a @nytimes exposé to find out how much the President pays in taxes. We should require them to release their tax returns and stop them from owning business empires on the side. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would do both.\nhttps://t.co/IOnB9zehDl

Trump hopes that if Americans like you don't trust your vote will be counted, you'll just give up in despair. We won't let that happen. But we need Republicans in Congress &amp; the Cabinet to find a backbone and say they will not be complicit in undermining our democracy.
Refusing to peacefully transition power, meddling with ballots, and silencing voters are the tactics of a dictator. It's up to Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – including Trump's Cabinet – to make clear that the voters will determine the next President.
In July I asked four Cabinet secretaries to commit that they wouldn't let Trump use federal troops or agents to suppress democracy. None did – three didn't respond at all. AG Barr, @EsperDoD, @DHS_Wolf, @SecBernhardt: What are you waiting for? https://t.co/ZmO0ImjLcE

OSHA's shameful inaction during this crisis has degraded the public's faith in the agency to protect workers, especially workers of color. @OSHA_DOL should look at this mountain of evidence and finally do its job by issuing an Emergency Temporary Standard for COVID-19.
So we're clear: @OSHA_DOL could have forced meatpacking plants to make safety changes in the early days of the pandemic. Instead OSHA sat on its hands while these companies made false claims to Congress and the public that they were protecting their workers from COVID-19.
At least 27,000 meatpacking workers have contracted COVID-19. But @OSHA_DOL waited months to issue the smallest fines possible for two meatpacking plants. @SenBooker and I want answers from @OSHA_DOL on its feckless actions to protect these workers. https://t.co/Lr1CAkLlcU
200,000 Americans are gone from COVID-19. People we loved, people we grieve for, and people we couldn't tell goodbye. Too many people who could have been saved if our federal government had done more. https://t.co/lZYeYvKU0Z

We need to go further and pass my Ending Too Big to Jail Act to hold big bank executives responsible when the banks they lead break the law. And we need to create a new unit at @USTreasury to investigate these types of financial crimes. https://t.co/xqDaa4DUjA
Big banks and companies abuse legal loopholes and exploit weak enforcement by regulators to profit from criminals and terrorists. We must root out this corruption and clamp down on the dark money that flows through the global financial system. https://t.co/2pO48buqzd

We still must do everything we can to help the people of Puerto Rico recover from the hurricanes and earthquakes, the economic crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. That starts with leadership in our federal government that respects all of its citizens. I will stay in that fight.
Three years ago today, Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. I saw firsthand how Trump's slow and ineffective response led to thousands of deaths and untold misery. The cruelty wasn't an accident – it was part of their plan.
Last night I stood at the steps of the Supreme Court and told the thousands of people gathered there: in Ruth Bader Ginsburg's memory, I will fight. https://t.co/MFoUouWlRW
With voting already underway for the 2020 elections, Ruthie's "most fervent wish" was for her replacement not to be named "until a new president is installed." We must honor her wish.
Later, Ruthie's groundbreaking work as a legal advocate for women led to a distinguished career as a federal judge and a Supreme Court Justice. Her lifelong dedication to fighting for justice for everyone, and her love for our nation, will be sorely missed.
As a young mom heading off to Rutgers law school, I saw so few examples of female lawyers or law professors. But Ruthie blazed the trail. I'm forever grateful for her example — to me, and to millions of young women who saw her as a role model.
Ruthie was my friend and I will miss her terribly. The t-shirts simply labeled "RBG" made her notorious. But it was her wit, her tenaciousness, and her skill as a jurist that made her an icon.
All three of my brothers returned safely from military service, but many do not. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we remember POWs, missing servicemembers, and their families. Their service and sacrifices will never be forgotten. #POWMIARecognitionDay https://t.co/RI2uZABm15
Rebuilding our economy so workers &amp; communities can share in prosperity requires real change – not empty promises. I'm urging the @BizRoundtable members to operationalize the principles they claim to hold &amp; reconsider supporting the reforms in my Accountable Capitalism Act.
I asked the @BizRoundtable members from @JPMorgan, @Walmart &amp; other top companies for their tangible plans to implement their newfound values. I also asked them to support my Accountable Capitalism Act to help them give their workers a stronger voice. I heard crickets.
Last year, America's CEOs at the @BizRoundtable made a big splashy announcement about their commitment to their workers. One year and a pandemic later, it's clear that was a public relations stunt. https://t.co/S8Jkwi7SoD
The Authorization for Use of Military Force became law 19 years ago. Congress gave up its constitutional role to authorize force, which enabled endless wars, humanitarian crises, &amp; indefinite detention. Let's repeal the AUMF &amp; invest more in diplomacy to keep our country safe.

Every time Trump tells the American people not to trust our doctors, scientists, and public health experts, he undermines our country's pandemic response and puts millions of lives at risk. This reckless behavior of a desperate President needs to stop now. https://t.co/yIIcTSRxay
Trump &amp; DeVos have blocked debt cancellation at every chance for public servants, defrauded students, &amp; disabled veterans. Here's how I see it: if Trump won't cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt now, Dems are ready to act in 2021. #CancelStudentDebt https://t.co/xHaKmwBw6C
Canceling student loan debt will provide immediate relief to millions struggling during this pandemic. It will increase Black &amp; Latinx families' wealth &amp; help close the racial wealth gap. And it will deliver a much-needed boost to our economy. #CancelStudentDebt
Student loan borrowers were in crisis before COVID-19 plunged our economy into chaos. But the President already has the power to help families right now. @SenSchumer &amp; I are introducing a resolution today calling for Executive Action to #CancelStudentDebt.https://t.co/MuciXrrVfJ
Our broken mass incarceration system has devastated Black &amp; Brown communities. A new @BrennanCenter report shows that the formerly incarcerated face lower wages long after release, worsening the racial wealth gap. We must reform our criminal justice system.https://t.co/Uc7l14D1vG

Reports that an @ICEgov detention center is performing mass hysterectomies on immigrants are horrifying. Congress must hold hearings now to investigate these possible human rights violations &amp; the long line of medical abuse &amp; neglect at these facilities. https://t.co/tH2edqfh9t
This fight isn't over. The ruling can &amp; will be appealed. But Congress must act. The House passed the American Dream &amp; Promise Act over a year ago. The Senate must do the same. We must protect TPS holders &amp; their families from the Trump admin's racist &amp; anti-immigrant agenda.
I'm deeply disappointed by the 9th Circuit decision to end TPS for over 300,000 immigrants. These families are part of the fabric of our communities &amp; economy. Many have been our essential workers during this pandemic. Ending protections for them now is just plain cruel. https://t.co/3o0ozbKTPK

We can't ignore how jails &amp; prisons are incubators for COVID-19. @RepPressley, @PattyMurray, @SenBooker &amp; I have a bill to make correctional facilities publicly report their COVID-19 data to contain this pandemic &amp; protect the health of incarcerated people, staff, &amp; the public. https://t.co/T8d5AR6ftA
Grocery workers didn't sign up for a job to put their lives at risk, but they're doing it every day. No more excuses. The Senate needs to pass a real relief bill that forces giant grocery chains to reinstate hazard pay for workers during this pandemic. #ProtectEssentialWorkers
Major grocery chains don't want to pay workers hazard pay during a pandemic — but they've got plenty of money for stock buybacks that help CEOs and shareholders get rich. This is disgusting. https://t.co/UqEeSjXS8t

It's a federal crime to lie to Congress. If @SmithfieldFoods' CEO was aware of @OSHA_DOL's findings at the same time he called allegations of worker mistreatment demonstrably false, he should be held accountable.
A few months ago, @SmithfieldFoods' CEO said our concerns about the company exploiting workers are "patently and demonstrably false" &amp; whined about being treated unfairly in a full page @NYTimes ad. This meager, months-too-late fine isn't enough. https://t.co/TfBH9vsFdi
I've called for @OSHA_DOL to do its job &amp; increase enforcement, but this is shameful. OSHA could have issued a citation for violations of social distancing guidelines in every section of the plant. They could have classified the violations as willful &amp; charged higher penalties.
I'm glad @OSHA_DOL has now acknowledged that failing to keep workers safe from COVID-19 is a violation of the general duty clause. But they investigated this Smithfield facility in March – why did they wait until thousands of workers got sick, &amp; some died, before taking action?
.@SmithfieldFoods exploited the COVID crisis &amp; put thousands of lives at risk. @OSHA_DOL shrugged as workers died, then issued the lowest possible fine for endangering thousands of workers, sending a message that companies won't face real accountability. https://t.co/BC1KaNPSbi

19 years ago, nearly 3,000 Americans died when terrorists attacked our country. On 9/11, let's unite to remember the victims, survivors, and their families, and recommit to caring for our first responders and their loved ones.
Big Tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, &amp; Apple have way too much power over our economy &amp; our democracy. For the good of our country, we must demand our regulators do their jobs &amp; take swift, aggressive action – not kick the can down the road one more time.
The case against Google is clear. We can't let a desperate and reckless Attorney General undermine @TheJusticeDept's case. But we also can't let Big Tech's army of lawyers, lobbyists, &amp; consultants use Barr as an excuse to wriggle out of the law.
I've spent years calling out @TheJusticeDept for refusing to enforce antitrust laws – including against Google. There's no question that DOJ should've done something about Google's consolidation long ago. The real question is what's taking them so long. https://t.co/ZIxNmPtgCz
Google uses its size to bully competitors, snuffing them out with mergers &amp; demoting their products. We must hold Google accountable &amp; #BreakUpBigTech. That means allowing @TheJusticeDept's antitrust investigation to continue without political interference.https://t.co/VS0dyOAa1t

This whistleblower report reveals @DHSgov's illegal leadership running the department as a propaganda organ, denying Russian interference and white supremacist threats for a corrupt President. Trump, @DHS_Wolf &amp; @HomelandKen put the country at risk. https://t.co/9fjixILoXd
Tens of thousands of Americans died because the President of the United States is more concerned with his headlines and poll numbers than the health and safety of our families, friends, and neighbors.
People are more likely to be vaccinated if they trust officials are basing decisions on science, not conspiracy theories. Trump has undermined that trust. I told @NIHDirector Collins and @Surgeon_General Adams: it's time to kick politics out of the COVID-19 vaccine effort. https://t.co/owZjj9x7d7
We know that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is sabotaging the @USPS, &amp; our report is more evidence that his tenure has been a failure. He needs to resign – &amp; if he won't, the Board of Governors must remove him.  https://t.co/bT9gG6Uz0D
USPS delays have also caused a big jump in prescription reshipments &amp; higher costs to send with @USPS competitors. Those costs could end up being passed along to consumers &amp; the federal government, which covers prescription drugs under Medicare, Medicaid, &amp; other programs.
More Americans are getting medications filled by mail during COVID-19. But our report found that @USPS delays slowed delivery times by a lot. What used to take 2-3 days now takes 3-4 &amp; many take far longer. That's a serious &amp; inexcusable health risk.
Three weeks ago, @SenBobCasey &amp; I asked mail-order pharmacies about @USPS delivery problems under Louis DeJoy. We found big delays that threaten millions of people's health during this pandemic, &amp; higher costs that could be passed along to taxpayers. https://t.co/7e5YF6jwa9

Divide and conquer is an old story in America, and racial hatred has always been part of keeping the rich and powerful on top. We cannot fall for this ugly blame game – especially while so many Americans are suffering.
Real leadership is about deescalating violence by listening to Black Americans who can't watch another friend or neighbor die at the hands of police. It's ordering DOJ to step in and stop racist policing. It's pushing the Senate to pass a bill to fundamentally change policing.
Trump fans the flames of violence and white supremacy. Race, religion, heritage – the more factions the better in Trump's America of fear and hate. When we turn against each other, we can't unite for equality and justice – or fight back against Trump's failures and corruption.

We know that racial disparities exist in COVID-19– but that doesn't make the MA data any less jaw-dropping. We must keep fighting to contain this virus and help families – especially in Black and Latinx communities, and regardless of immigration status. https://t.co/uUZDqsJCyO
I'll say it again: talk is cheap. I'm watching Louis DeJoy's actions, not just his words – and working with my colleagues to hold him accountable. https://t.co/3M3EiNB5cO
The fight for racial equality and justice is just as important today as it was 57 years ago during the first #MarchOnWashington. As Dr. King said: "There comes a time when silence is betrayal." Keep marching and making your voice heard.
Investors &amp; the public have been calling for companies to disclose more information about their risks from the #ClimateCrisis. But instead, @SEC_News chose to weaken rules about what corporations have to share with the public. I've got a bill to fix that. https://t.co/WmWrbojkHs
We asked @DeptofDefense in April how it's protecting servicemembers from COVID-19. The Pentagon dismissed the concerns with false accusations, but cases have exploded since. Again we expect answers from @EsperDoD on our concern for servicemembers' health.  https://t.co/iXbBpV8ES2
Widespread COVID-19 testing is crucial for containing the virus, but backlogs and delayed test results weaken these efforts. @SenTinaSmith &amp; I have asked some of the biggest testing labs about their testing capacity to help stop future backlogs &amp; delays. https://t.co/ep6oOQXJK9
We need answers now. The @CDCgov needs to put science over politics. https://t.co/DfSc6W59b1
We urged @COVID_Oversight earlier this year to open an investigation into the Trump administration's politicization &amp; incompetence in the COVID-19 response. Our concerns have only worsened since then. The committee must do its job to protect the American people.
There's a slew of new evidence that Trump has put politics first during this pandemic: only helping governors who are his friends, slowing down testing to hide the real case numbers, &amp; pressuring the CDC &amp; FDA. The IG must investigate these incidents.
Trump's repeated politicization of the COVID-19 response is a public health &amp; economic threat. Tens of thousands of Americans are dead because of these failures. @SenBlumenthal, @SenMarkey &amp; I want @COVID_Oversight to investigate this partisan interference.https://t.co/eA9cJnG7WZ
Shady location data brokers like Venntel are scooping up people's\n location history and then selling it to law and immigration enforcement. This is unacceptable. I've opened an investigation into the government contracts held by location data brokers.\nhttps://t.co/WbM2O2Qjnf

We need a #GreenNewDeal to tackle climate change, rebuild our economy, &amp; fight for #EnvironmentalJustice. I'm proud of @SenDemsClimate for helping to build a strong, diverse coalition to fight the #ClimateCrisis. Check out the #CaseForClimateAction report:\nhttps://t.co/QsxB4Tihbe
Chad Wolf has turned @DHSgov into President Trump's personal militia to terrorize American citizens and immigrants, without regard for the Constitution. Wolf failed this illegal trial period. He should resign, and no senator should vote to confirm his undeserved nomination. https://t.co/qQaiBp9U5p
The @US_FDA's drug approval process must be guided by science, not President Trump's partisan &amp; political whims. @SenMarkey and I want to see communications between the White House &amp; FDA about the emergency use authorization for plasma to treat COVID-19. https://t.co/amGca3Vqtu
Protestors in Belarus are bravely raising their voices to fight for democracy, but Trump's White House has stayed quiet. Belarus deserves free and fair elections, and a government that works for all its citizens – not a corrupt dictator. https://t.co/2g3L1R7xjT
If Dr. Slaoui wants a role in the vaccine response, he should do so as a government employee subject to the same ethics rules as everyone else. Americans deserve full faith and confidence that our COVID-19 officials are working for the public good, not to line their own pockets.
In May, @SecAzar described Dr. Slaoui as one of two "leaders" of Operation Warp Speed, the federal vaccine program. Now, @HHSgov tells us that Slaoui will not be making decisions that would subject him to ethics rules. Both things can't be true.
.@SenBlumenthal, @RepJayapal and I want @HHSgov and the company Dr. Slaoui \"works\" for to show us the contract and tell us more about this unprecedented and deeply inappropriate arrangement that allows the vaccine czar to avoid resolving his glaring conflicts of interest.
Remember how the White House vaccine czar had millions in stock for COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers? @HHSgov confirmed to us that Dr. Slaoui used a loophole to evade the ethics laws &amp; keep his @GSK stock: working as a "contractor" for $1. Unbelievable.\nhttps://t.co/ew7rm5YPc3
The former coal lobbyist leading @EPA gutted environmental rules &amp; let corporate polluters police themselves. @SenMarkey &amp; I won't tolerate the EPA's junk explanations for this get-out-of-jail-free policy that hurts low-income &amp; communities of color most. https://t.co/CP8m0NHdPI
The chief @SocialSecurity actuary ran the numbers and confirmed: Trump's plan to gut Social Security would cause disability insurance to run out in 2021 and benefits for seniors and survivors to run out in 2023.

Trump pressured the @US_FDA to approve a COVID-19 treatment before it's been fully reviewed. This isn't cutting red tape – it's strong-arming public health experts for the President's political purposes. FDA actions must be based on science, not politics. https://t.co/1mBlco31yi
My bill to extend and expand the eviction moratorium is ready to go. So is @SenSherrodBrown's bill for rental assistance. What are you waiting for, @SenateMajLdr McConnell? You can't just close your eyes and think this problem will go away on its own. https://t.co/HkUkcRmdAH
My anti-corruption bill would close the ridiculous loophole that allows part-time officials to keep their financial disclosures secret. And it would prevent federal officials like Louis DeJoy &amp; the @USPS Board from owning or trading individual stocks. We must #EndCorruptionNow.
The @USPS Board's "full support" of Louis DeJoy's efforts to delay and degrade mail service raises serious questions about its members' motivations. DeJoy has stock in Amazon &amp; USPS competitors – we should know if the USPS Board has conflicts affecting their actions too.
My staff requested the @USPS Board of Governors' financial disclosure reports to look for conflicts of interest, but they're "not releasable" since they work less than 130 days/year. That's a dumb loophole. The Board should voluntarily release the reports. https://t.co/SCcUZAY1j6
My heart is with the victims of the devastating California wildfires tonight, as well as the people of the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico in the paths of Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura. The federal government must do everything it can to help these communities.
Donald Trump's executive order that cut unemployment checks and stuck states with the tab has been a total failure for struggling Americans. The @SenateGOP must stop playing games with people's lives and fully fund the $600 checks right now. https://t.co/hT501HbE7w
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is still in a coma after being poisoned. Trump says nothing, but his silence speaks volumes. It's clear he'll never stand up to Putin – whether he puts bounties on our soldiers' lives or tries to kill a rival. https://t.co/dY5fqUrbq1
The more we learn about what's happening at the @USPS, the clearer it is that this isn't just the work of an unqualified and incompetent Trump megadonor, but a methodical act of sabotage by the Trump administration. https://t.co/g8kiqYajDj
If you haven't yet read this awful story about what's happening at the @USPS, do it now. This problem isn't only about delayed ballots – it's about people's health and safety, and risks to our economy. We must keep fighting to #SaveThePostOffice. https://t.co/FhQPDusuRA
Reality check: Only participants in the #IranDeal can reimpose UN sanctions on Iran, but Trump withdrew from it. The Trump Iran policy makes us less safe &amp; more isolated from our allies. Let's rejoin the nuclear agreement &amp; get Iran back into compliance. https://t.co/sWoNX4FCPa
The @HouseDemocrats are doing their jobs to help fund @USPS &amp; protect it from sabotage. Just like they did their jobs &amp; passed another COVID-19 bill months ago. Show some political courage &amp; finally stand up to Trump, @SenateMajLdr McConnell. Call back the Senate &amp; let us vote.
Massachusetts has an election coming up on September 1st, and we're already feeling the @USPS delays. Americans are right to be worried about DeJoy's empty promises. Congress &amp; the Board of Governors must reverse this damage that threatens our democracy. https://t.co/PirkshlLp3
The @USPS Board of Governors has a responsibility to serve the public interest. That means delivering the mail on time – not acting as accomplices for the Postmaster General's partisan sabotage. If the Board won't fire Louis DeJoy and reverse the damage, they should resign too. https://t.co/7lA3mlyRw3
Louis DeJoy flat-out lied to the Senate today about the changes he's implemented at the @USPS, refused to cooperate with requests for documents, and rejected the idea of fixing his damage. Enough is enough: the Board of Governors must remove DeJoy &amp; reverse his acts of sabotage.
I'm watching Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testify in the Senate right now about his corrupt actions to sabotage the @USPS. I hope you'll watch too.  #SaveThePostOffice https://t.co/ZDt4KtAonQ
Postmaster General DeJoy's sabotage of the @USPS threatens families, small businesses, and our democracy. DeJoy never should have been appointed Postmaster General in the first place – now it's time for him to learn what accountability looks like.
10. DeJoy said that he would "suspend" initiatives until after the election.\n\nAs @SenSchumer has demanded, will you provide a detailed list of those initiatives, Postmaster DeJoy? Will you commit to permanently reversing every one that undermines service? https://t.co/HQgL4XIqsZ
9. The VA confirmed that vets' prescriptions have seen nearly 25% delays this year. This can be a life or death delay.  \n\nWill you commit to eliminate any delivery delays of VA prescriptions, Postmaster DeJoy? How about delays for seniors on Medicare?\nhttps://t.co/XODCqwzCGl
8. Trump has spread lies &amp; conspiracy theories about mail-in voting during a pandemic.\n\nHas Trump or his staff ever requested/suggested you make it harder for people to vote by mail, Postmaster DeJoy?https://t.co/ccCeXQK5VZ
7. Trump said @USPS needs money "in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots."\n\nDo you agree with President Trump that USPS needs more money, Postmaster DeJoy? Does the Senate need to fund the USPS? https://t.co/i63OrT7cPr
6. Americans are worried about reports that the cost of mailing in their ballots could triple.\n\nWill you commit to returning to the @USPS practice of treating all election mail as First Class mail, without any additional costs to voters, Postmaster DeJoy?\nhttps://t.co/KD6JXCOVYz
5. Thanks to my request, DeJoy is under investigation by @OIGUSPS.\n\nWill you fully comply with the IG's investigation, Postmaster DeJoy? How about any criminal investigation? And will you adopt any OIG recommendations to address your conflicts https://t.co/haKWXZ8lCR
4. DeJoy holds millions of dollars of stock in XPO Logistics, which does business with @USPS. How can he claim to make impartial decisions with a straight face?\n\nWill you divest from any company that does business or competes with USPS, Postmaster DeJoy? https://t.co/Dlmsk25Ul8
3. DeJoy sold Amazon stock on June 24, but bought Amazon future stock options at the same time. He was betting he could cash in on the stock's dip &amp; then rebound.\n\nDid that have anything to do with your efforts to sabotage the @USPS, Postmaster DeJoy? https://t.co/Dlmsk25Ul8
2. DeJoy cut back on overtime when our @USPS workers will need more overtime to deliver the mail now, &amp; mail-in ballots during this pandemic.\n\nWill you commit to approve all requests for overtime between now and the election, Postmaster DeJoy? https://t.co/Xl9NnOpFyu
1. DeJoy ordered the @USPS to remove mail sorting machines &amp; collections boxes, &amp; admitted he has no plans to fix the damage he's already done.\n\nWill you replace the mail sorting machines &amp; boxes that you ordered the Post Office to remove, Postmaster DeJoy?https://t.co/ODclRrELHb

This is a start. But we still need to reverse all the damage, fully fund @USPS, &amp; investigate DeJoy's conflicts.

After 100 years, we still have a long way to go to make this democracy equal for people of every gender, race, ability, sexual orientation and background. But let's remember today the power we have to come together, raise our voices, and finally see progress made. #WomensVote100
We need to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to fight racial discrimination in voting. We need a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote to all Americans. And we need to fight back against Trump's efforts to make it harder for Americans to vote. #WomensVote100
But we can't talk about women's suffrage and ignore the ugly truth: these early efforts excluded Black women and other women of color. And we must recognize that racist laws and practices still keep Black and Brown Americans from participating in our democracy now. #WomensVote100
Today we celebrate 100 years since the 19th Amendment was ratified. The women who won our suffrage were told over and over again to give up, but they persisted. We have the right to vote today because they didn't listen. #WomensVote100 https://t.co/ybE1aQNxC7 https://t.co/9ecCNG4SUh

If Donald Trump cared about helping Americans, he would have demanded @SenateMajLdr McConnell start negotiating as soon as the House passed the HEROES act almost two months ago. These legally dubious actions aren't real relief for states and families – they're a cruel joke.

We cannot cut off help to families still struggling in this crisis. We must extend &amp; expand the eviction moratorium &amp; help people pay their rent &amp; utilities. We must extend the $600 unemployment checks. And we must support schools, save child care, &amp; #StandWithEssentialWorkers.
The unemployment rate for white Americans is 9.2%. The rate for Black Americans is 14.6%. That racial gap isn't a bug – it's a part of the long-term systemic racism in our economy. That's why I've introduced a bill to add this to the Fed's mission. https://t.co/e71mmS3pOK
Here's the deal: tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs. Some are going back to jobs with pay &amp; hours cut. Many jobs won't come back until we contain the virus. Many won't come back at all. And Black &amp; Latinx workers are still suffering the worst. https://t.co/dBRzfLqQiX
Trump &amp; his Postmaster are sabotaging @USPS. They are delaying Social Security checks &amp; other mail &amp; potentially disenfranchising millions of voters. @oigusps should investigate Trump megadonor Louis DeJoy's bad decisions &amp; personal conflicts of interest. https://t.co/wqYlltwznE https://t.co/6YXgvBOJky
Access to clean water and electricity are basic human rights, and they're more important than ever during a pandemic. The Senate should pass the bill I'm co-leading with @SenJeffMerkley and @RepRashida to stop utility shutoffs and help low-income families. https://t.co/7gcfN93G23
I'm concerned that Trump picked his new @DoD_IG precisely because he won't stand up to him. I told his nominee: we need watchdogs at the Pentagon who will safeguard our democracy, even if it means preventing the President from turning the military into his own personal militia. https://t.co/tRFAWvYcXK
Trump appointed a new Special Envoy for Iran who was convicted of lying to Congress and has a history of supporting military force to overthrow governments. Trump's Iran policy hasn't made us safer or helped the Iranian people. Elliott Abrams won't help. https://t.co/yReOoUdGMc
In CA, @NancySkinnerCA has a bill to tackle this problem by banning the bulk sale of foreclosed homes, but Congress must do more. We can start with my affordable housing bill to stop the pipeline of mortgages being sold to private equity firms &amp; my bill to #StopWallStreetLooting.
After the 2008 crash, corporations grabbed up homes &amp; became the worst kind of slumlords. We can't let history repeat itself with a private equity real estate grab. Read my op-ed with @carroll_fife on what we must do to confront this looming crisis. https://t.co/sSKnYP7wXT
Instead of protecting voting, Trump is undermining the safety &amp; legitimacy of the 2020 elections &amp; making it harder for many to vote. I put out a plan months ago to protect our elections – Congress must make this a priority in the next relief bill. #VRA55 https://t.co/Vzb42seNnQ
55 years ago today, President Johnson signed the bipartisan Voting Rights Act into law to fight racial discrimination in voting. The Senate should come together once again today to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act &amp; restore those key voting protections. #VRA55
We need comprehensive &amp; publicly available COVID-19 data from prisons &amp; jails to manage this pandemic &amp; protect the health &amp; safety of incarcerated people, correctional staff, &amp; the public.
The COVID-19 in Corrections Data Transparency Act requires the BOP, USMS, &amp; state &amp; local correctional facilities to send data weekly to the CDC on COVID-19 testing &amp; cases for inmates &amp; staff, &amp; publicly report that data on their websites. Detailed demographic info is required.
COVID-19 is out of control in prisons &amp; jails. All 10 of the largest US clusters are correctional facilities. @RepPressley, @PattyMurray, @SenBooker, @RepSylviaGarcia, @RepYvetteClarke, @RepRobinKelly &amp; I have a bill to find out the severity of this crisis.https://t.co/V0IyafCMUI
The wave of evictions that will soon hit our country will devastate millions of families – especially families of color. Republicans can't use these terrified families as a bargaining chip. We must pass my bill to extend &amp; expand the eviction moratorium. https://t.co/hSdZuFVo57
Treatment services for people with mental health or substance use disorders are more important than ever during this crisis. We need information about outbreaks at these facilities so we can direct resources to protect the health &amp; safety of these especially vulnerable people.
I investigated COVID-19 cases at assisted living centers with @SenMarkey &amp; @RepMaloney. Residents were 5 times more likely to test positive. Inpatient treatment facilities have similar risks, but they also don't report their COVID-19 cases to HHS or CDC. https://t.co/YvmWj3leIu

Medicaid is there when our friends and neighbors need help the most. That's why states like NE, OK, and now MO have voted to expand it. Health care is a basic human right and Congress must boost Medicaid in the next COVID-19 relief bill. #NoOneLeftBehind https://t.co/7NqGwGLiPM
Trump &amp; McConnell still don't have a plan to fight COVID-19 – but @SenateDems do. We've got a slate of bills we're pushing for in the next relief package, including my bill with @RepAndyLevin to build a national contact tracing program. Let's get this done.https://t.co/ELmrFL4wSZ
Fed Chair Powell confirmed to me in June that racial gaps in our COVID-19 recovery are "not a healthy feature of our economy." Our bill requires the Fed to take deliberate action to address systemic racism &amp; inequality. https://t.co/cxLSfCgYQe
The Federal Reserve Racial &amp; Economic Equity Act:\n✔️ Makes reducing inequality part of the Fed's mission\n✔️ Requires the Fed Chair to identify employment, income, &amp; wealth disparities in their testimony to Congress\n✔️ Requires robust reporting based on race, gender, &amp; education
Racial employment &amp; wage gaps don't just happen on their own – they're a result of specific policy choices. I'm introducing a bill with @RepMaxineWaters to make the @FederalReserve use their existing authorities to fix these disparities. https://t.co/sNbWLSBzTq
Keeping families in their homes is a public health &amp; economic requirement. We have to extend the full $600 supplement to unemployment checks &amp; the eviction moratorium so struggling families can pay the bills. If we don't, spending dries up &amp; our economy will stall even more.
Democrats want to invest in testing &amp; contact tracing to bring the virus under control, support schools &amp; child care centers, &amp; address the huge disparities facing Black, Latinx, &amp; Native communities.
Anyone debating whether we should invest in public health versus the economic recovery is missing the point: It is not possible to fix the economy without first containing the virus. https://t.co/EM8dXhlWlL
My heart goes out to the victims of the horrific explosion in Beirut and their loved ones. The US should rally the international community to help the Lebanese people overcome this tragedy and urgently address the country's economic collapse and overburdened health system.
Yes, Trump failed &amp; COVID-19 has brought the US to its knees. Corrupt &amp; racist policies broke a system that never worked for many in the first place. But we're not a nation of quitters. I still believe different policies can make big, structural change. https://t.co/JrSiWoyVJh

The government needs a warrant to access telecom companies' cell phone location data. Brokers like @Mobilewalla could help the government dance around the 4th Amendment. @RepMaloney, @RonWyden, @RepDeSaulnier &amp; I want to know how Mobilewalla's data could be targeting people.
Shady data broker @Mobilewalla collected location data from thousands of #BlackLivesMatter protesters without their knowledge &amp; wrote a report about it. We have huge concerns that this data could be sold to the government &amp; weaponized by the police or ICE. https://t.co/ukL13US4Cm
We must pass a $50 billion child care bailout to save our child care system from collapsing. We must get our schools the funding they need. And we must have a national plan to contain this virus so kids can safely return to school and moms (and dads) can safely go back to work.
I felt like a failure trying to juggle my young kids &amp; teaching job. If schools &amp; child care had closed &amp; my Aunt Bee had to social distance, I would've quit. I wouldn't be here in the Senate today.\n\nWe can't let that happen to this generation of moms.\nhttps://t.co/W4AI96IIhV

Smithfield didn't provide answers to the workplace safety questions @SenBooker &amp; I raised – they provided attitude. We need an @OSHA_DOL Emergency Temporary Standard for COVID-19 &amp; an Essential Workers Bill of Rights to hold @SmithfieldFoods accountable for protecting workers.
An estimated 2,000+ workers at @SmithfieldFoods facilities have become sick with COVID-19. Some have died. Smithfield took @OSHA_DOL to court to keep data on their biggest outbreak private.\n\nAsking about the safety and survival of Smithfield workers is not baseless criticism.
Instead of investing in their workers' safety, @SmithfieldFoods ran a full-page Sunday @NYTimes ad – whining that they're being treated unfairly after they rigged the rules to exploit the pandemic and put thousands of lives at risk. Well boo-hoo, Smithfield.
Tata still has a job at the Pentagon today not in spite of his repugnant statements, but because of them. @JimInhofe &amp; @EsperDoD did Trump's dirty work to avoid an embarrassing hearing and bypass the Senate. Their blind loyalty to Trump puts our national security at risk.

This latest scandal raises even more questions about the inability of @WellsFargo and its leadership team to comply with the law and the needs of its customers. Our federal banking regulators shouldn't let up until Wells Fargo follows the law and treats its customers fairly.
Wells Fargo got caught opening millions of fake accounts for customers. It charged people for auto insurance they didn't need until their cars were repossessed. The list goes on and on. @WellsFargo swears they've changed, but the bank is fundamentally broken.
I thought @WellsFargo had run out of ways to scam its customers. I was wrong. It turns out that the bank has been placing non-delinquent borrowers in mortgage forbearance without their consent. This is inexcusable. https://t.co/KbLN1zi3b0

@SenBlumenthal But I'm sure a lot of people are thinking, @SenBlumenthal: "This #StopCOVIDCorruption stuff sounds great, but who's going to enforce it?" What happens when Trump fires another IG or ousts another whistleblower? And what is that Congressional Oversight Commission doing?
@SenBlumenthal And let's ban any company that receives a government bailout from lobbying or political spending for at least a year after taxpayers are repaid. Sorry, Trump-connected lobbyists, the gravy train would end. #StopCOVIDCorruption https://t.co/xYrjy6yAsS

The stability of our financial system is at risk if the Fed conducts inadequate tests, draws the wrong conclusions, &amp; fails to take the necessary steps to protect our economy in this crisis. The American people deserve full transparency about the health of the banking sector.
Despite the troubling stress tests, the Fed inexplicably announced that it wouldn't force big banks to suspend dividend payments to wealthy shareholders. And it's baffling that the Fed wants to roll back important bank capital requirements.
Big banks take annual stress tests to make sure they won't crash our economy. But the COVID-19 crisis blew those test scenarios out of the water &amp; the Fed hid the results of its additional analyses. @SenBrianSchatz &amp; I are concerned by the Fed's actions. https://t.co/5hsKT3zWQW

Parents &amp; educators want schools to be able to safely reopen – but they don't want to risk lives or make the pandemic worse. But President Trump &amp; @BetsyDeVosED don't seem to care – they are pressuring schools to open in-person no matter what.
The use of paramilitary federal forces against civilians is a historic embarrassment &amp; harms our credibility in the world. The @DeptofDefense, @TheJusticeDept, @DHSgov &amp; @Interior should not be used as Trump's authoritarian playthings. We're supposed to be better than this.
We're less than 100 days out from Election Day &amp; Trump is exploiting the protests to run fear-mongering TV ads. I'm worried that Trump will take more dangerous &amp; outrageous actions to pit federal officers against their own people in the days before &amp; after the 2020 election.
President Trump's deployment of federal forces in Portland &amp; potentially more US cities is reprehensible. AG Barr, @EsperDoD, @DHS_Wolf &amp; @SecBernhardt should not allow their troops &amp; agents to be used against people exercising their right to protest. https://t.co/ZmO0ImjLcE

Without high-speed broadband, Native communities are shut out of a 21st-century economy &amp; have limited access to life-saving services – a big crisis during this pandemic. Our bill affirms Native Nations' sovereignty &amp; provides a path to desperately needed connectivity.

Magic wands &amp; glitter dust won't solve the economic crisis that's getting worse. Republicans need to wake up, extend unemployment benefits, expand the eviction moratorium, &amp; work with Dems on a real relief bill now. It's the right thing to do for our economy &amp; for our families.
This is about economics – but it's also about our values. We'll make it through this pandemic &amp; recession stronger if we care for our neighbors &amp; we invest in helping people pull through. These are Democratic values – and these are American values.
Tax cuts for billionaires won't solve this crisis. Neither will protecting giant corporations. In fact, nothing in the 40-year playbook of failed Republican economic policies will keep working families from falling off this economic cliff &amp; undermining our economic recovery.
Families of color will suffer the most from the GOP's inaction. Black &amp; Latinx families have been hardest hit by job loss. They are twice as likely to face food insecurity. We risk making the racial injustices in our economy worse if we don't act. https://t.co/gRxM1uVQEm
On top of this, 40 million Americans face a student loan cliff. If Congress lets emergency relief for borrowers expire, an avalanche of loan payments will overwhelm millions of Americans right as their income gets cut, leading to a wave of defaults. https://t.co/r5GpsaRCZY
The lost income &amp; expired eviction moratorium will put more families at risk of homelessness. More people will get sick &amp; die. And our economy &amp; families – especially families of color – could be hit even harder than 2008. https://t.co/hFt9gmzK0r

Cutting CARES Act employment checks to $200 a month – like McConnell is suggesting – will hurt families &amp; hamper our economy. Economists predict that this will result in a 2.5% lower GDP &amp; 3.4 million fewer jobs being created over the next year. https://t.co/TmcHom2QD1
When the unemployment checks dry up, kids go hungry &amp; families can't pay for basic necessities. That drop in spending means more businesses will shut their doors, costing another 5 million jobs. It's morally bankrupt &amp; bad economic policy. https://t.co/4mPgUzsMy8
In fact, many of the ways that economists measure the overall health of our economy – like mortgage delinquencies, personal bankruptcies, &amp; credit card defaults – weren't as bad as forecasters had feared because Congress stepped up to help families. https://t.co/BOJfZ07vZx
For 30 million Americans out of work, expanded unemployment benefits have been a lifeline to stay above water. But they also cushioned the blow of this recession for everyone as families pumped the extra income right back into the economy. https://t.co/5XjLQzpVWk
Let's be clear how we got here. While Trump &amp; Pence were bungling the COVID-19 response, Mitch McConnell refused for months to even entertain the idea of another relief bill. Now time's up &amp; his caucus still can't get on the same page on the bill they've been writing in secret.
The federal eviction moratorium is gone. States are delivering their final CARES Act unemployment checks now. And months after the House passed another relief bill, the GOP still doesn't have a real plan to help millions of Americans pay their rent or keep our economy afloat.

Here's what you won't read in Big Tech's bought-and-paid-for research: Amazon, Google, Facebook &amp; Apple have too much power over our economy, society &amp; democracy. They think they're too big to be held accountable. We need to break up Big Tech &amp; stop mergers that kill competition.
Big Oil funds junk research that climate change isn't real. Wall Street peddles sham studies that banking rules hurt the economy. And Amazon &amp; Google pay for a think tank to say Big Tech isn't too big &amp; too powerful.\n\nThis is thinly-disguised corruption. https://t.co/CxGh4XEpZz
Big Ag companies have crushed competition and risked their workers' lives while regulators look the other way. They can't be trusted. We need to massively reform our broken food and farm system to give workers, farmers, and consumers real bargaining power.
If meatpacking companies say they're doing everything required to protect workers from COVID-19, but workers are still getting sick &amp; dying, then voluntary guidance isn't enough. The next relief bill must include an @OSHA_DOL Emergency Temporary Standard for COVID-19.

Venezuela was already suffering from a political, economic, &amp; humanitarian crisis before COVID-19 hit. It would be dangerous &amp; cruel to force Venezuelans in the US to return right now. The Senate should finally do what the House did a year ago this week &amp; pass #VenezuelaTPSNow.
Let's be clear about who is most at risk to lose their homes because of the GOP's failure to act: communities of color. Failing to institute an eviction moratorium would further deepen existing racial injustices.\nhttps://t.co/0Ac0AnxEtJ
The federal eviction moratorium ends TONIGHT. Millions could lose their homes because the GOP can't get their act together to pass a bill. My bill to extend &amp; expand the eviction moratorium for all renters is ready to go. The @SenateGOP needs to stop blocking it &amp; pass it now. https://t.co/WkLsbZIm7m
I'm fighting right now to keep people in their homes during this crisis. And I'm also still fighting for my bill to help homebuyers in formerly redlined areas. We should be confronting our history of govt-backed housing discrimination, not repeating it.\nhttps://t.co/oi1DAHoNqs
Housing discrimination still exists, and the Black/white wealth gap is bigger now than when housing discrimination was legal. It's unbelievable that @SecretaryCarson is ripping up the rule that helps communities address the ugly legacy of segregation and housing discrimination.
Black and Brown Americans hit hardest by COVID-19 are facing a wave of evictions. Americans are demanding an end to systemic racism. And Trump and @SecretaryCarson think now's the time to gut civil rights laws like the Fair Housing Act. This is disgusting.\nhttps://t.co/87kMXH92lc
I asked @JusticeOIG to investigate the role of Attorney General Barr &amp; @TheJusticeDept in the sickening Lafayette Square attacks. I'm glad that IG Horowitz has agreed to review this ugly propaganda event &amp; the appalling attacks in Portland. https://t.co/3wh410NZ1V
Trump &amp; his team have repeatedly belittled COVID-19 risks, but more than 140,000 are dead &amp; we can't pretend long-term risks like heart damage &amp; strokes don't exist. We want to know what the administration is doing about COVID's chronic health impacts. https://t.co/y2j8oOmucs
About 628,000 tribal households don't have access to reliable internet, and COVID-19 has made it difficult for tribal nations to apply under a rapidly approaching deadline.

Americans can't wait any longer for the GOP to get their act together on another relief bill. The federal eviction moratorium ends TOMORROW. I'm heading to the Senate floor to urge my colleagues to pass my bill to extend &amp; expand that moratorium. https://t.co/Oe2qq6kP7U

Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos have failed our students and failed our schools. Yesterday I told our Massachusetts teachers: we will not allow the lives of students, teachers, and school staff to be used as a bargaining chip to get them the funding they need. https://t.co/Kpcq5AFzgh
This important new climate study shows: we can't let Trump roll back rules for giant corporate polluters &amp; hope everything will be ok. It won't. We need bold action now to fight the #ClimateCrisis &amp; its threats to our country, planet, &amp; future generations. https://t.co/DQaifCKdBL

I introduced legislation before Trump was sworn in to require that Presidents divest from their businesses – including golf courses. It's part of my big bill to #EndCorruptionNow. Congress could put an end to this blatant corruption by passing that bill. https://t.co/6w2Ce2fAyV
Tell us, Mr. President: are you working for the American people, or are you lining your pockets running a golf course? We shouldn't have to ask. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/5XPx3lq0JC
Back in March 2017, @SenatorCarper &amp; I asked the @OfficeGovEthics to clarify whether Ivanka Trump is subject to federal employee ethics rules. (She is.)\n \nSo OGE should investigate whether she violated those rules by tweeting an endorsement of Goya beans.\nhttps://t.co/vpYel07373
This is good news for Massachusetts residents. Now Congress needs to extend and expand the federal eviction moratorium for all renters by passing my bill. https://t.co/XJewjjxFCn
It is flagrantly unconstitutional to exclude people from the Census count based on their immigration status. The Constitution requires that every person be counted. This is another attempt by Trump to use scaremongering against immigrants &amp; rig the system. https://t.co/bOHZxBP6aG
Our democracy has been beaten up badly. But when people ask me why I'm still hopeful that we can make real change, I remind them of what happened 10 years ago today. We took on an impossible David vs Goliath fight to hold Wall Street accountable – and won. And we can do it again.
We also wouldn't have a strong @CFPB without people like you. The financial industry spent $1 million a day fighting Wall Street reform – especially the agency. But people &amp; groups all across the country jumped into the fight &amp; made their voices heard. And it made a difference.
We wouldn't have a strong @CFPB today without President @BarackObama &amp; Vice President @JoeBiden. They believed in my idea for the agency, fought to keep it in the bill, and helped to get it across the finish line. I'm eternally grateful their leadership.
Here's the way I see it: before the ink from President @BarackObama's pens were dry, Wall Street's army of lawyers &amp; lobbyists were already out to kill the agency. Trump's team has spent 3+ years trying their hardest to break it. But the @CFPB is still here &amp; here to stay.
Things aren't easy at the @CFPB right now. @MickMulvaneyOMB &amp; @CFPBDirector Kraninger gutted the office that fights lending discrimination &amp; have given the green light for payday lenders to trap consumers in cycles of debt.
I talk &amp; tweet about the @CFPB every chance I get because I'm proud of that new agency. It has handled more than 2 million complaints &amp; returned billions back into the pockets of Americans cheated by big banks &amp; financial institutions. That's government that works for the people.
Ten years ago today, I ran out of a hearing, jumped into @SenatorDurbin's car, &amp; we raced as fast as we could across town to watch President @BarackObama sign the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill into law. I'll never forget it – because that's how the @CFPB was born. https://t.co/wPE2VusWgf
The Senate needs to act now to contain this virus and provide the funding so our economy, schools, and families can begin to recover.\n\nHere's my must-do list in the @NYTimes:\nhttps://t.co/n0EnIKy7nh
We will not contain this deadly virus if Congress allows our most vulnerable Americans to be thrown out of their homes right now. The Senate must pass my bill to extend and expand the eviction moratorium before it expires. https://t.co/HJmoBwOeml
Millions of families are going to fall off the economic cliff if the @SenateGOP doesn't wake up and extend unemployment benefits. You're only making this crisis within a crisis worse by dragging your feet, @SenateMajLdr McConnell. https://t.co/2551xs30pG
I'm all in. https://t.co/372zv4m7L4
Canceling student debt will provide real relief to millions of families during this crisis, help lift a financial burden that is holding back a whole generation of Americans, fight the racial wealth gap, and boost our economy. Let's do this. https://t.co/XbUDA2kLFd
I introduced a bill in June with @SenBlumenthal, @ChrisCoons, @RepJayapal &amp; @RepSarbanes to restrict &amp; disclose lobbying &amp; political spending for COVID-19 relief funds. Congress should include our CORE Act in the next relief bill to #StopCOVIDCorruption. https://t.co/TqgJRK8ufS
I stand in solidarity with workers who are participating in the #StrikeForBlackLives for higher wages, health care, paid sick leave, and the right to join a union. We must dismantle the systemic racism that exploits Black workers and hurts Black families. https://t.co/HAp0z9JKGd
Too many Americans have died because Donald Trump and his team were too arrogant to listen to the public health experts, too slow to recognize they were wrong, too stubborn to change direction, and too cowardly to take responsibility. https://t.co/0oCzCDzXq2
Trump's multitude of failures have resulted in a public health catastrophe. If he sabotages our federal efforts to contain this virus, it will be his fault when more Americans die. The GOP must finally stand up to their President so that doesn't happen. https://t.co/ZeyUT7qOSR
Senator McConnell should honor @RepJohnLewis with more than words, and finally hold a vote this week on the Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore the key voting protections that John Lewis fought and bled for in the 1965 Voting Rights Act. https://t.co/JUhBOhqckn
John Lewis was a true American hero and the moral compass of our nation. May his courage and conviction live on in all of us as we continue to make good trouble for justice and opportunity.\n \nRest in power, John.

Canceling student loan debt would stimulate our economy through this pandemic, give relief to millions of Americans, and address systemic racism by helping to close the racial wealth gap. This is about economics, but it's also about our values.\nhttps://t.co/l0b3spJYg0
People outside of Washington get it: one way to address the economic crisis facing working families is to broadly cancel student loan debt. \n\nThat's why I'm fighting with @SenSchumer, @PattyMurray, and others to include it in the next relief package. https://t.co/9YBD2PX3lm
If Facebook is committed to fighting disinformation on Facebook &amp; Instagram like they claim they are, they must immediately acknowledge in their fact-checking process that the #ClimateCrisis is not a matter of opinion &amp; take steps to stop the spread of climate disinformation.
The #ClimateCrisis is too important to let conspiracy theorists, corporate polluters, &amp; armies of lobbyists, bought-and-paid-for researchers, &amp; climate-denying politicians spread deliberate lies. #ClimateChange is an existential threat to communities &amp; economies around the world.
Trump isn't the only one who gets a pass to spread disinformation on Facebook. Facebook has a new fact-checking loophole to allow blatant lies about the #ClimateCrisis. @SenatorCarper, @SenWhitehouse, @SenBrianSchatz, &amp; I want answers from Mark Zuckerberg. https://t.co/esRACT08E3
Our country is about to face an avalanche of evictions during the pandemic that will hit Black, Brown, &amp; low-income communities the worst. The Senate must keep people in their homes by passing my bill to extend &amp; expand the eviction moratorium. https://t.co/r41ZTZ8uR2

HHS @SecAzar claimed Trump got an "amazing deal" on the COVID-19 drug remdesivir – but the US is paying the highest prices in the world. We want HHS to explain why it got such a bad deal – and why it didn't use its legal authorities to keep prices down. https://t.co/bh5eQxON6w
The COVID-19 public health emergency declaration has helped states like Massachusetts expand life-saving services during the pandemic. But this crisis isn't over. The entire Massachusetts delegation is urging @HHSgov to extend the declaration before it expires in nine days. https://t.co/yTglhGX2h3
I've got a bill that would make #TaxDay easier by allowing millions of Americans to simply sign &amp; return a pre-filled tax form. Congress could save taxpayers billions of dollars &amp; countless hours preparing taxes by passing my bill for return-free filing. https://t.co/GTCm49wi7N
For 5+ years, I've pushed to replace the IRS Free File program that let tax prep companies trick people into paying for services that should be free. I'm glad that earlier this year, the IRS reformed Free File to let the IRS compete with these companies. https://t.co/56WV2ruKLl
Domestic workers like Lydia are on the frontlines of this pandemic, &amp; I'm fighting for an Essential Workers Bill of Rights to protect workers like her.

Communities across the country are calling for real reforms to end the systemic racism that plagues policing in America. That starts with holding officers &amp; police depts with a history of racist/discriminatory policing accountable. Congress must pass our bill to do just that.
The Enhancing Oversight to End Discrimination in Policing Act would:\n✅ Rescind the Sessions limits on the use of consent decrees\n✅ Empower state AGs to pursue pattern or practice investigations\n✅ Triple funding for DOJ's @CivilRights Division to pursue these cases
Under Obama, @TheJusticeDept investigated racist policing &amp; forced police depts to reform. Trump's DOJ made it harder to enter into these consent decrees. So @RepRichmond, @SenatorDurbin, @maziehirono &amp; I have a bill to strengthen these investigations. https://t.co/YYfOqxvPfG

Most people assume retirement advisers must do what's best for their customers, but conflicts cost families $17B/year. @USDOL needs to scrap its proposal &amp; work on a strong conflict of interest rule that protects Americans' retirement savings &amp; complies with Congress's intent.
In December I warned @USDOL not to propose a conflict of interest standard that mirrored the SEC's deeply flawed new rule for broker-dealers. It waters down the fiduciary standard that has governed advisers for decades. But that's what DOL did. https://t.co/xPcx5u19QN

In 2016, @BarackObama's @USDOL wrote a strong conflict of interest rule so retirement advisers would have to put their clients' interests first. But in 2018, Eugene Scalia sued to overturn it. Now Scalia wants to replace it with a weaker standard. https://t.co/JCTxrTKXCe
I have serious concerns about the safety &amp; security of US servicemembers who may have Russian-funded bounties on their heads. I've also asked the US commander in Afghanistan for information about what the military is doing to protect our servicemembers. https://t.co/jiyeL2FcG1

Trump seems to echo the Kremlin as he dismisses reports that he knew &amp; did nothing about Russia paying militants to kill US soldiers. @MazieHirono &amp; I want @SecPompeo, @EsperDoD, @RobertCOBrien &amp; @DNI_Ratcliffe to come clean about what Trump knew &amp; when. https://t.co/Y1RNcku5mZ https://t.co/wfqZxcOUyC
We need to boost our country's pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity for the COVID-19 crisis &amp; any future pandemics. @SenTinaSmith &amp; I have a new bill to end our over-reliance on foreign countries &amp; give us the tools to produce critical drugs here at home. https://t.co/M7UpGvjsK6
Thank you, @RyanBudhu, for sharing the tragic story of your brother's death in police custody and challenging all of us – especially those of us with privilege – to confront racism in this country. https://t.co/rKQ92tgMK2
Public health officials &amp; assisted living residents &amp; their families need to know about COVID-19 cases &amp; fatalities. @RepMaloney, @SenMarkey &amp; I have a new bill to enact strict data collection and reporting requirements for assisted living centers. https://t.co/pVWDj2xbHm
My report with @RepMaloney &amp; @SenMarkey found:\n❌ 24% of assisted living facilities had at least 1 COVID-19 case. 8% had 10+ cases\n❌ 43% of infected residents were hospitalized. 31% died.\n\nThat means about 7,000+ assisted living residents may have died from COVID-19 as of 5/31.
Assisted living centers have similar COVID-19 risks as nursing homes but not the same regulations &amp; reporting requirements. We investigated assisted living operators &amp; found alarming infection &amp; fatality rates. Congress must require this data collection. https://t.co/YvmWj3leIu
I support the Cambridge City Council's resolution of solidarity with @WholeFoods workers who want to wear #BlackLivesMatter masks &amp; speak out against systemic racism. This is an absurd policy. But @Amazon must do much more to address the racial inequalities in their company.
Workers of color at @Amazon warehouses &amp; @WholeFoods stores have spoken out for months about unsafe COVID-19 conditions. Black whistleblowers have been fired &amp; subjected to racist slurs by executives. And workers have described a "pattern of racial bias." https://t.co/FLUFVpeagl
Amazon has no problem making money selling #BlackLivesMatter masks on their platform. If the retail giant believes in those words &amp; isn't just exploiting them, they will let @WholeFoods employees wear their masks. https://t.co/VJuCFci7h4
HHS reportedly plans to add personal information to its COVID-19 database. I'm worried that sensitive HHS data could be accessed and weaponized by agencies like ICE. It's happened before. @HHSgov must explain how they are protecting people's privacy. https://t.co/wPaj4O4pZ3
The pandemic – and its human and economic costs – grow daily because the Trump administration has failed to deliver on every aspect of the coronavirus response. It is well past time for @VP Pence, Trump, and this administration to address these problems and save American lives.
Here's the reality: the White House ignored the threat of COVID-19 until it was too late to stop it, left states without the equipment to adequately fight it, did not do enough to work with states to contain it, and is now shirking its responsibility to continue to address it.
Dr. Fauci told me the US could see 100,000 new cases of COVID-19 per day if we don't shift course. But rather than ramping up testing &amp; contact tracing, securing our supply chain, &amp; sending clear guidance to Americans, @VP Pence &amp; the Trump admin declared victory over the virus.
COVID-19 is surging and Dr. Fauci gave a catastrophic warning to me yesterday. Either @VP Pence doesn't have the slightest comprehension of the outbreak, or he is deliberating trying to mislead the American people. He owes the American people answers. https://t.co/qLIPMWyw9b
.@RepDebHaaland &amp; I asked @USCCRgov to examine the impact of the federal government's COVID-19 response on Native communities. The Commission is doing so. It will hold a virtual public briefing &amp; seek public input. I hope those most directly affected will make their voices heard. https://t.co/ZFqZdJJ3p2
It's July 1st, the rent is due, &amp; millions of families have no idea how they're going to pay it. The Senate must step up to extend &amp; expand the eviction moratorium that expires this month to keep people in their homes during this pandemic. https://t.co/kzZahQMON4
Glad to see a fearless woman scientist like @REMLehmann taking the helm at @WhiteheadInst. Congratulations and welcome! https://t.co/jbeBoJAWLw
Removing the names, symbols, &amp; monuments that honor Confederate soldiers who killed Americans in defense of slavery is only one step toward addressing systemic racism in the US. But it's an important step. Congress has the power &amp; responsibility to end this injustice. https://t.co/nv9j7C6kyp
