Let's be clear: equal justice under law is at stake with this Supreme Court nomination.

Republicans want to strike down the Affordable Care Act. If they succeed, you could have to pay for mammograms, cancer screenings, and birth control. Young adults aren't guaranteed being on their parents' plans. Seniors could pay more for prescription drugs. It's all at stake.
The morning after our first date, @DouglasEmhoff emailed me a list of his available dates for the next couple of months: 'I want to see if we can make this work.' And we did.\n\nDougie, happy birthday. I could not imagine anyone else I'd rather be with on this journey called life. https://t.co/fh94VL4Uzk
The majority of Americans believe that the next president should fill the vacant Supreme Court seat. \n\n@JoeBiden and I stand with them.
Senate Republicans haven't lifted a finger for 150 days to help the millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table during a pandemic—yet they're trying to rush through a Supreme Court confirmation hearing. You see where their priorities lie.
It's because of @BarackObama and @JoeBiden that over 20 million Americans have gained health care coverage and people with pre-existing conditions are protected from being charged more or being denied coverage. That's on the line. https://t.co/0LfHyea2YR
Here is what's at stake with this Supreme Court nomination:\n\nVoting rights.\nWorkers' rights. \nConsumers' rights.\nSafe and legal abortion.\nAnd so much more.\n\nWe must listen to the American people and confirm a new justice after voters decide who they want in the White House.
This Supreme Court nomination process is illegitimate and deliberately defies the will of the people. Republicans will stop at nothing to jam through a nominee who will take health care away from millions of Americans during a global pandemic.
Three years ago today, Trump signed an executive order undercutting the Affordable Care Act. \n\nToday, he's in court trying to get rid of the ACA and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions—and rushing through a Supreme Court justice who will help ensure that.

With their selection of a nominee to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, Republicans have made it clear: they intend to destroy the Affordable Care Act's protections for more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions and overturn reproductive rights.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence don't have a national testing plan for coronavirus or a national strategy for contact tracing. They failed to lead and, now, more than 213,000 Americans have lost their lives.
On #WorldMentalHealthDay, we affirm that mental health is just as important and real as physical health. Together, @JoeBiden and I will work to expand access to care and put an end to the stigma around mental health.

On January 28, Donald Trump and Mike Pence were informed about the nature of this pandemic. \n\nThey knew it was lethal. \nThey knew it was airborne. \nThey knew it affects young people.\n\nThey knew what was happening—and didn't tell you.
If we use our vote and we use our voice, we will win. Watch a recap of last night's debate now. https://t.co/mJ6vHhAFjL

Vote early. Go to https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt to find out how.
Just last ​week,​ Donald Trump stood on a​ debate stage ​and refused to condemn white supremacists.\n\nThis isn't the first time he's been an apologist for racists. This is a pattern. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.
Donald Trump has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. https://t.co/ZHw9VeSTaL
I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not Donald Trump's.
The American people want us to fill a seat right now—but it's not on the Supreme Court; it's the one in the Oval Office.
Donald Trump called John McCain a "loser."\n\nHe let Putin get away with placing bounties on the heads of our troops.\n\nHe called fallen soldiers "suckers."\n\nIt's a pattern. And it proves just how unfit he is to be commander in chief.
Donald Trump prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over that of the American intelligence community.
Joe Biden is responsible for saving America's auto industry. And Mike Pence voted against it. So let's set the record straight. \n\nThank you.

.@JoeBiden will not ban fracking. That is a fact.
.@JoeBiden and I believe the economy is doing well when our workers and our families are doing well. That's why our tax plan won't ​raise taxes on anyone making under $400K​ and will cut taxes for middle-class families.
Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said, "You mean $750,000?"
The day @JoeBiden asked me to serve with him was one of the most memorable days of my life. My mother—who came to the United States at the age of 19—I know would be so proud. https://t.co/QdSG66vNO3

Trump didn't share information about the virus because he wanted you to stay calm. \n\nI want to ask you: how calm were you when you were hunting for toilet paper? How calm were you when your children couldn't see their grandparents because you were afraid they could kill them?
How Donald Trump and Mike Pence handled the coronavirus crisis is the greatest failure of any American presidency.

Trump has inflamed the racial divides in our country these past four years. But getting Trump out of office won't be enough. @JoeBiden and I have a plan to root out systemic racism across our laws and institutions—in everything from policing to housing.
.@JoeBiden spoke truth when he told the American people: "This is not about my family or his family. It's about YOUR family."
Science shows that wearing a mask doesn't just protect you—it protects others.\n\nWearing a mask isn't just the right thing to do, it's patriotic. https://t.co/2Al9IhOkI2
Trump knew. \nHe knew COVID-19 passes through the air.\nHe knew it was deadlier than the flu.\nHe knew it was dangerous to everyone.\n\nYet he purposely downplayed the pandemic—and now more than 205,000 Americans are dead.
Trump says he has a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe has no plan.
Let's be clear: the next Supreme Court Justice could determine health care for over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, reproductive rights, and so much more. We can't let those rights be trampled.
At 9pm ET tonight, @JoeBiden will face off against Donald Trump in their first of three debates. I know Joe is going to bring everything he's got to that debate stage tonight, and fight for our values with honor and decency. Tweet below to wish Joe good luck tonight.

More than one million Americans have already voted in the election. They have a right to elect their next president who will make a decision about the vacancy on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/uJtZunOXML
Vote as if your life, your choice, depends on it—because it does.\n\nMake it clear to Trump and to every Republican Senator that, if they're determined to get rid of your health care, you'll be just as determined to vote them out of office.
It's inexcusable that so many Americans—including those working on the front lines to combat this deadly pandemic—paid more in taxes than this president did in 2016 or 2017. https://t.co/WxQzhKKOT9

Justice Ginsburg was known to pose the question, "What is the difference between a bookkeeper in the Garment District and a Supreme Court justice?" Her answer: "One generation."\n\nReplacing her with a justice who would threaten that progress and her legacy would be a travesty.
Trump and the Republicans have made it clear they will pick a justice who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act. It's a decision that could have devastating consequences for Americans across our country. https://t.co/7ZpMjNgjjD

We can't let the infection that Trump has injected into the presidency and Congress—which has paralyzed our politics and pitted Americans against each other—spread to the Supreme Court.\n\nThis election is about more than the presidency or the Senate: it's about our democracy.
Trump and Republicans' relentless obsession with overturning the Affordable Care Act—driven entirely by a blind rage toward President Obama—is especially damaging at a moment when the country is suffering through a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives.
Trump and the Republicans are about to learn something. They may feel they have the power in this country. \n\nBut they don't. \n\nThe American people have the power—at the ballot box.
When Justice Ginsburg passed away, not only did we lose a giant from the Court, but from American life. Few people in our history have done more to change more lives than she did as a lawyer, an advocate, and a Supreme Court Justice.\n\nShe was an inspiration for each of us.

Keep speaking Breonna Taylor's name.

The Supreme Court makes decisions on issues that affect millions of Americans—including health care, the economy, our fight for racial justice, climate change, and more. \n\nThe voters must choose a president, and that president should nominate Justice Ginsburg's successor.
When given the chance to address the coronavirus pandemic and save American lives, Donald Trump failed. Now, America now has 6.8M infections, and nearly 200,000 Americans have died.\n\nWe need a president who will take this virus seriously. That's @JoeBiden.

It's not enough to only recognize those that lost their lives on this day nineteen years ago—it's incumbent upon us to also remember the more than 2,000 first responders, workers, and local residents who have since died from 9/11-related illnesses.
May the cherished memory of those we lost on September 11th serve to remind us both of who they were as individuals, but also of who we are as a nation: Brave. Resilient. United. https://t.co/uTBkj9MYBf

When Trump was saying young people couldn't get coronavirus, he knew they could.\n\nWhen Trump was saying it was the same as the flu, he knew it was deadlier.\n\nWhen Trump was purposely downplaying the severity, he knew it passed through the air. \n\nHe knew.
Trump's reckless disregard for the health and safety of the American people has torn apart families and communities. It's unforgivable. https://t.co/Lf43fP9r6T

As @JoeBiden said earlier today, Trump's choice to knowingly downplay the seriousness of COVID-19 was "a life or death betrayal of the American people."\n\nAs we mourn the 190,000 Americans who have died, we must also act. Vote him out.
Trump knew in February. \nHe knew that COVID-19 passes through the air.\nHe knew it is deadlier than the flu.\nHe knew it is dangerous to more than just our elderly and vulnerable.\n\nHe purposely downplayed the pandemic. And now, 190,000 Americans are dead.
Donald Trump knowingly betrayed the American people.\n\nHis refusal to act cost 190,000 Americans their lives, and tens of millions their livelihoods.\n\nHe is unfit to be president. We must vote him out in November. https://t.co/iBwJcqczG7

As president, @JoeBiden will make sure that we treat all American workers as "essential"—all the time, not just in times of crisis.
Trump has abdicated his duty and failed to lead on every significant aspect of our country's COVID-19 response. We can't let that happen with a coronavirus vaccine. The stakes are too high to not get this right. https://t.co/tdf296qPbp

@BarackObama @JoeBiden Mr. President, thank you for taking the time out of your day to chat about @JoeBiden. Can't wait to see you on the virtual campaign trail!
.@JoeBiden's favorite things aren't just aviators, ice cream, and Amtrak. Thanks, @BarackObama, for giving me the inside scoop on what it's like to work with our next President.\nhttps://t.co/ZoGCkk9OKc
Here's what separates @JoeBiden and me from Donald Trump and Mike Pence: We know that educators, electrical workers, and working Americans are the true backbone of the American economy—not CEOs and hedge fund managers. And when elected, we will work every day to deliver for them.
.@JoeBiden is right. We must build a future that not only offers good-paying jobs, but protections and dignity for all workers. https://t.co/eeS5kapK3J
There's no better day than Labor Day to spend time with union members in Wisconsin. The work labor unions do each and every day matters. It's because of them and the determination of workers across our country that we have overtime pay, worker protections, and more. https://t.co/2ZCsMiaOCY
Laced up and ready to win.\nhttps://t.co/scLX6nNJXo
Strong unions built the American middle class—everything from a 40-hour work week to paid leave was because of workers who organized and fought. And when @JoeBiden and I are in the White House, advancing worker rights will be a priority.
As the pandemic still rages, essential workers—who are disproportionately Black, people of color, immigrants, women, and members of other marginalized communities—continue to sacrifice so much. Today, we pay tribute to them. https://t.co/fgMhnAUKqe
This Labor Day, returning to the status quo isn't good enough for American workers and working families. We need to build back better.\n\nThat starts with one word: Unions.\nhttps://t.co/a6xUzDqABn
To all the workers who have kept our country going: Thank you. From those essential workers picking up another early shift to front line health care workers working on extra shifts, your nation owes you a debt of gratitude. We will keep fighting for you.
Trump keeps saying the economy is improving—but the truth is, only the wealthiest are reaping the benefits. Meanwhile:\n→Over 100,000 small businesses have closed their doors for good\n→Almost 30M people are on unemployment\n→Too many families are unsure how to pay their rent
Howard taught students that we could do anything—and that we didn't have to be confined by anyone else's idea of what it means to be Black. https://t.co/bVMoe1ZnSh
Americans are hurting and they need to know their leaders have a plan to help our country recover. @JoeBiden and I will ensure we build back better than before. https://t.co/4tL29p4qzk
We must pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, support automatic and same-day voter registration, and help fund secure state voting systems. \n\nThat's what @JoeBiden and I will do when we're in the White House.
Family means everything to me. I've had many titles throughout my career, but Momala will always be the one that means the most to me. https://t.co/SKDAFeun51
Unlike our two systems of justice under Trump's administration, a Biden-Harris administration will fight for equal justice under law—for all. https://t.co/KF2SYv4dHX
Why do you think they don't want us to vote? We all know the answer: It's because they know when we vote, things change. When we vote, we will be seen, we will be heard, and elected officials will be held accountable. VOTE.
This weekend, we must remember that labor built the middle class in our country and lifted up working Americans. We have unions to thank for better wages and safer working conditions. When @JoeBiden and I are in the White House, workers will have us fighting by their side.
Milwaukee, can't wait to see you soon!\nhttps://t.co/W0YyleLew7
Three years ago Trump tried to end DACA.\n\nHe failed in the courts, but Dreamers still face uncertainty today.\n\nOn day one @JoeBiden will send a bill to Congress to create a path to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11M undocumented people who've strengthened our country for years.
Stay safe this weekend and wear a mask. \nhttps://t.co/svhKayxcLd

Today marks exactly two months until Election Day. Let's roll up our sleeves and keep making every moment count. Donate if you can. Volunteer to talk to voters. Tell your friends and neighbors what's at stake. \n\nIt's going to take a lot of hard work—but together we can win this.
The violence we're seeing right now, the pain we're seeing right now, this is Donald Trump's America—not Joe Biden's America.\n\nAnd oftentimes it has been fanned and encouraged by Trump himself. Don't buy into his fearmongering.
.@JoeBiden is right. The challenges our students, parents, and educators are facing as schools reopen is a national emergency and must be treated as such. \nhttps://t.co/sxNIK5p1Vv
With only 62 days until Election Day, now is the time to make a plan to vote.\n\nMake sure you're registered at https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt.\n\nThen make your plan. Vote early if you can, either in-person while wearing a mask or by requesting a ballot by mail. Your vote matters.
Everyone wants schools to reopen, but we must prioritize the safety of our students, educators, staff, and families. \n\nInstead of bullying and threatening schools like Trump has done, @JoeBiden has a plan to reopen and keep them safe.\nhttps://t.co/4omRbhdPm4
Absolutely heartbreaking. Across our country, over 184,000 American lives have been claimed by coronavirus, leaving families and communities torn apart. It's not like this in the rest of the world. All we needed was a competent president.\nhttps://t.co/yEfW8t4C78
Families are packing into their cars in the early morning, hoping the food bank has something left when they get there.  \nChildren can't visit their grandparents in their last moments. \nSmall business owners are shutting their doors every day.\n\nThis is Trump's America.
Only when we come together for meaningful police reform and broader criminal justice reform will we be able to reckon with racial injustice in our country. https://t.co/GZn5tkf4d8

In March, Trump told governors, "Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment, try getting it yourselves."\n\nThat day we had about 5,000 cases as a nation.\n\n...Today we have nearly 6 million.
Unlike Trump, as president @JoeBiden will actually follow the advice of scientists, experts, and economists. https://t.co/F1EqVa8WZf
Emmett Till was abducted and brutally murdered on this day in 1955. He was only 14. \n\nTo this day, lynching is still not considered a federal hate crime. Our country must work to confront this dark, shameful part of our nation's history and right this wrong.
In this election, there are two clear choices: a president who will continue to sow hate and division in our country or @JoeBiden who will work to unify all Americans and restore the soul of our nation.\nhttps://t.co/vYpwonHZ6k
On the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington, let's continue to march on for justice, in the name of our ancestors and in the name of our children and grandchildren. https://t.co/BlP5oCEbxW
We need a competent president—one who is willing to listen, willing to lead, take responsibility, have a plan, do their job. @JoeBiden will be that president. Join us→\nhttps://t.co/OJ0uhPLNsm
It was his obligation to protect us. And yet, he has failed. Miserably. https://t.co/dMo1XFz8Iy
"We are focusing on the science, the facts, and the data." —Trump https://t.co/P8zu2iodHR
As President, @JoeBiden will put his coronavirus plan into effect on day one:\n→Deploy rapid tests with immediate results\n→Manufacture the medical supplies and PPE we need\n→Implement a nationwide mandate to wear a mask—in Joe's words, not as a burden, but to protect each other
Let's be clear: at the beginning, Trump was convinced if his administration focused on this virus it would hurt the market and hurt his chances of being reelected.\n\nThat mattered more to him than saving American lives.
Here's the reality: the United States has nearly six million confirmed cases of coronavirus, 180,000 lives lost, and more than 50 million claims for unemployment this year alone.\n\nIt didn't have to be this way. https://t.co/ee61Zr9j2d
Yesterday, @JoeBiden and I spoke with the Blake family. They are an amazing group of people with extraordinary courage.\n\nEven in their pain and grief, even as they seek justice for their son—they spoke about the need to end the violence and heal the nation. https://t.co/TybfVXAlVB

.@BarackObama and @JoeBiden had a program that tracked emerging diseases in places like China. Trump cut it. \n\nObama and Biden dedicated a team on the National Security Council to global health security and biodefense. Trump eliminated it. \n\nIt didn't have to be this bad.
Here's the thing about the nature of a pandemic: It's relentless.\n\nYou can't stop it with a tweet.\n \nIf you get it wrong at the beginning, the consequences are catastrophic. And Trump got it wrong from the beginning—and then he got it wrong again...and again.
The Republican convention is designed for one purpose—to soothe Donald Trump's ego. To make him feel good.\n\nBut it's not supposed to be about him—it's supposed to be about us. The people.
The numbers that define the crisis we're facing today are staggering:\n\n→Nearly 6M confirmed cases of coronavirus\n→180,000 lives lost\n→More than 50M claims for unemployment this year alone\n\nWe need to see and hear what's happening in our country.
.@JoeBiden and I encourage everyone in California impacted by the wildfires and those in the Gulf Coast affected by Hurricane Laura to continue following guidance from your local authorities to stay safe. We pledge to be there for those whose lives have been turned upside down.
The consequences of Trump's failure to lead and combat the coronavirus have been catastrophic. Tune in now. https://t.co/BB4eVkk3yF

Time to roll up our sleeves and get to work to build back a better America. Chip in now. \nhttps://t.co/Im5gnSBvNG
Trump minimized the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis.\nHe muzzled public health experts.\nAnd misled the American people.\n\nNow we're all paying the price for his failed leadership.
Let's be clear where Trump and Pence got us: millions out of work, students across our nation who cannot go back to school, and 180,000 lives cut short by coronavirus.
Right now, Donald Trump is in court trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. If he's successful, over 20 million people will lose their health coverage.\n\nHealth care justice is on the ballot in November.
On the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, it's more important than ever that we keep up the fight at the ballot box to honor the women who came before us. #FirstWomanVoter https://t.co/ogBkqYLh3l

In 70 days we have the chance to elect a president who will lead with hope—not fear—and restore dignity and compassion to the Oval Office. \n\nChip in now to make that happen.\nhttps://t.co/4jQ3Z1h9l5
As states across our nation continue to attack reproductive rights, especially abortion, it's more important than ever we have a president who will defend and expand these rights.\n\nAs president, @JoeBiden will codify Roe v. Wade and protect the constitutional right to choose.
Let's be real clear: Donald Trump failed to take coronavirus seriously from the start. His lack of leadership cost millions of Americans their jobs and led to more than 110,000 small businesses closing for good. \n\nAmericans deserve a real leader to fix this—and that's @JoeBiden.

Years from now, when this moment has passed, our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: ‘Where were ​you​ when the stakes were so high?'\n\nAnd we will tell them, not just how we ​felt​—we will tell them ​what we did. #DemConvention
.@JoeBiden and I are fighting to build a country where we can all see ourselves.\n\nThat's the ​vision​ our parents and grandparents fought for. \n\nThe ​vision​ that made my own life possible.\n\nThe ​vision​ that makes the American promise—for all its complexities—worth fighting for.
For George Floyd.\nFor Breonna Taylor.\nFor our children.\nFor ​all​ of us.\n\nAnd for the lives of too many others to name, we've gotta do the work to fulfill that promise of ​equal justice under law. Because ​none​ of us are free until ​all​ of us are free. #DemConvention
I am honored to accept the nomination for Vice President of the United States. \n\nI do so, committed to the values my mother taught me and to a vision that @JoeBiden shares—where all are welcome, no matter what we ​look​ like, where we ​come​ from, or who we ​love​. #DemConvention
My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives.\n\nShe taught us to put family first—the family you're ​born​ ​into​ and the family you ​choose​—but to also see a world beyond ourselves. #DemConvention https://t.co/xU61nLrUXx
That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me.\n\nWomen and men who believed so fiercely in the ​promise​ of equality, liberty, and justice for all. They ​organized​, marched​, and ​fought​—not just for their ​vote​, but for a ​seat​ at the table.

Happy Indian Independence Day! Reflecting on the past 74 years, it's remarkable how much progress our people have made in the fight for justice. I hope you'll join me today in celebrating and then commit to building an even better future.
America needs leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. A president who makes every challenge we face even more difficult to solve.\n\nWe don't have to accept that. In 80 days let's elect @JoeBiden and #BuildBackBetter.
Eight years ago today, the first DACA applications were accepted. Dreamers are Americans but they still remain under attack by this administration. On day one as president, @JoeBiden will take action to protect Dreamers from deportation and put them on a path to citizenship.

81 days. 81 days to organize, to mobilize, and fight to ensure we can finally say goodbye to the national nightmare we call Donald Trump.
85 years ago today Social Security was signed into law, but just last week Trump said he'll defund Social Security if reelected. \n\nThe choice in November is clear: we must elect @JoeBiden to strengthen and expand Social Security so our seniors can retire with dignity.
Just look where Donald Trump and Mike Pence got us: more than 16 million out of work. Millions of kids who cannot go back to school. More than 165,000 lives have been cut short by coronavirus, many with loved ones who never got the chance to say goodbye.\n\nThis was preventable.
This is what real leadership looks like. \nhttps://t.co/cJN9Ij8soz
When other countries were following the science, Trump pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News. \n\nLet me tell you this: when @JoeBiden is president he'll listen to the facts. He'll embrace science. And we will all be better for it.
My mother always use to say, "Don't just sit around and complain about things. Do something." I dearly wish she were here with us this week. https://t.co/RHO2VnlZs4
Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from @BarackObama and @JoeBiden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground.
I was so proud to stand with @JoeBiden earlier today as our party's nominee for Vice President, and I do so mindful of all the heroic and ambitious women before me whose sacrifice, determination, and resilience makes my presence here even possible.

Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont, and Wisconsin—today is Primary Day! Be sure to turn in your vote-by-mail ballot and stay safe by wearing a mask if you're heading to the polls. Every single vote makes a difference.
The USPS delivers medicine to our nation's seniors, helps small businesses, and ensures people can safely cast their ballots. \n\nIt should concern everyone that the Trump administration is actively undermining the USPS during a pandemic and right before the November election.
America is desperate for a strong, competent, and honest leader who seizes the moment, takes responsibility, and does everything possible to solve the crises plaguing our country. \n\nThat's why we must elect @JoeBiden on November 3rd.
From fighting against voter suppression to protecting the dignity of work, @ReverendWarnock is the voice that Georgia needs in Washington. Can you chip in now to help him join me in the Senate? Every dollar counts. \nhttps://t.co/gaM9PnwtqA
@RobertGarciaLB @RobertGarciaLB, my friend, my heart breaks for you and your entire family after another devastating loss. May your stepfather and your mother be your guiding light in the years to come. Doug and I are sending you our love.
This weekend we surpassed 5 million coronavirus cases in the United States. \n\n...And there is still no adequate national testing strategy. Trump and his administration have failed Americans.
Small businesses across our country rely on @USPS to get their packages to their customers as soon as possible. We cannot let Trump interfere with the Postal Service. \n\nIf you own or work for a small business, share your story about what USPS delays mean to you.
It has been 150 days since Breonna Taylor was murdered in her home. That's 150 days Breonna Taylor's family and friends have grieved what could have been.\n\nWe must keep saying her name and demanding justice because the police who killed her still have not been charged.
Let's get it done in November. \nhttps://t.co/wyakpoXM5t
Great news: my friend @harrisonjaime's race has now been labeled a toss up! It's going to take all of us to flip that Senate seat from red to blue and send him to the Senate. Can you chip in now?\nhttps://t.co/woOD7M6Ui2
Unlike Donald Trump, @JoeBiden recognizes why we are in this fight and actually understands what we must do to dismantle systemic racism in our nation and build a better America. https://t.co/Y0Rr2pGlrV
Horrifying and inexcusable. There is absolutely no reason police officers should be shooting at unarmed children. \n\nThe system must change—and that starts with holding officers accountable for misconduct.\nhttps://t.co/D2elZSktUY
Six years ago Michael Brown was killed at the hands of police, sparking a nationwide movement and a desperately needed conversation that we are still having to this day. We cannot give up fighting against police brutality.
87 days left until Election Day. That's 87 days to make a difference. 87 days to phone bank. To get people registered to vote. To donate to Democratic campaigns up and down the ballot. \n\nMake these 87 days count.
Trump just promised that if he wins reelection he'll gut Social Security and Medicare.\n\nA vote for @JoeBiden in November means protecting and expanding these benefits—ensuring our seniors have the ability to retire with dignity.
It could not be more clear they are trying to take down the United States Postal Service from the inside—at a time when we need it the most.\n\nCongress must immediately step up to save the Postal Service and safeguard our elections. There's no time to waste. https://t.co/S3sodtYEpX
Reminder: Trump is actively trying to overturn Obamacare during a global pandemic. His executive order is meaningless.
Once this pandemic is over, we can't go back to the way things were. We need to #BuildBackBetter. \n\n@JoeBiden has a plan to do that. \n\nHe'll revitalize American manufacturing and create millions of good-paying jobs, ensuring the future is made in America—by all of America.
There are two systems of justice when stealing hedge clippers gets a Black man life in prison but the officers who murdered Breonna Taylor are still free.\nhttps://t.co/N1xpJzY9r3

55 years ago today LBJ signed the Voting Rights Act into law, which aimed to protect the right to vote for all Americans.\n\nYet in 2013 the Supreme Court gutted a key section of this act and McConnell is currently blocking legislation to restore it. Our work isn't over.

8 years ago today a white supremacist walked into a Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, WI, fatally shooting 6 people. \n\nWe just honored El Paso and next week is the anniversary of Charlottesville.\n\nHow much longer will the rising threat of white supremacy go virtually unaddressed?
20 million Americans could be at risk of eviction by the end of September.\n\nThat's 20% of renters.\n\nIt's not enough just to extend the federal eviction moratorium—my RELIEF Act would help stop evictions and foreclosures for one year.
@votegardner2020 Congratulations Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner on your victory last night! Onward to November for another four years of fighting for a better and fairer St. Louis for all.
Our path to victory is through Ohio. And that includes electing @TimsDesiree to #OH10. After the tragedy in Dayton, she stepped up and decided to run to ensure no community grieves another mass shooting. Let's make that happen:\nhttps://t.co/k3KKLracXR
Americans deserve a president who has a generous spirit. That's @JoeBiden.\n\nThere's nothing about Donald Trump that is generous—unless it's to himself. https://t.co/L1gdnaNhdJ
This segment is still etched in my mind. 30 seconds was all it took for nine lives to be cut short in Dayton, Ohio one year ago—the second of back-to-back mass shootings. \n\nOne year later and still no comprehensive action to end gun violence.\nhttps://t.co/kgHJKBENhQ

The House passed the HEROES Act more than two months ago and instead of voting on it, Senate Republicans spent 10 weeks coming up with their own bill.\n\nTheir \"relief\" bill cuts expanded unemployment benefits, fails to stop evictions, and doesn't include nutrition assistance.

One year ago 23 lives were cut short in El Paso—the deadliest attack against the Latinx community in recent American history. An attack fueled by the flames of hate and division. \n \nGun violence is a national emergency in our country. It must be treated as such. #ElPasoStrong
Justice delayed is justice denied. And justice for Breonna Taylor has been delayed for far too long as the officers who murdered her still have not been arrested. \n\nKeep up the calls for justice.

Mitch McConnell and the GOP let the additional $600 in unemployment benefits expire. They let the federal evictions moratorium expire. With rent due today, millions aren't sure how they'll pay.\n\nThis is why I called for monthly payments back in March.\nhttps://t.co/qIki9CCdVL

Millions of people across our nation are teetering on a cliff right now. Rent is due tomorrow. Bills need to be paid. \n\nWe have the answers already but reckless Republicans won't act: recurring $2k payments, expanded unemployment insurance, and nutrition assistance.
Combating racial inequities must be prioritized—and @JoeBiden knows that. His #BuildBackBetter plan would help level the playing field for communities of color by doing everything from investing in minority businesses to raising the minimum wage.\nhttps://t.co/2CcTeetbvd
Election Day will happen in 95 days whether @realDonaldTrump likes it or not. \n\nBut to win the White House and flip the Senate, we have to roll up our sleeves and get to work. Now is the time to register to vote. Donate to a campaign. Phone bank. It matters.

Donald Trump ignored early coronavirus warning signs. Dismissed the seriousness of the threat. Attacked the advice of doctors and scientists. Failed to institute an adequate national plan for testing and contact tracing.\n\nNow nearly 150,000 Americans have died. This is on Trump.
We are in a historic economic crisis with no end in sight—now is not the time to slash additional unemployment benefits by $400 a week. \n\nI won't stop fighting for $2,000 monthly payments and extending unemployment benefits.

The federal eviction moratorium has expired. Millions of Americans are now at risk of losing the roof over their head. My heart aches for all those facing uncertainty right now. Congress must move immediately to protect renters. Let's start with my RELIEF Act to stop evictions.
Emmett Till should have turned 79 today. But he was just 14 years old when he was brutally murdered. \n\nRacism is still alive and well today yet just last month one Republican Senator blocked our bill to make lynching a federal crime. We still have a long way to go as a nation.
Yesterday the U.S. surpassed 4M coronavirus cases.\n\nThere's still no adequate national testing strategy.\nThere's still no adequate national contact tracing strategy. \nThere's still no adequate national PPE strategy.\n\nTrump can't absolve himself of responsibility—this is on him.

Last week I announced the RELIEF Act to help stop evictions and foreclosures for a year and stop landlords from raising rent.\n\nWe are on the verge of an evictions cliff and getting this passed is of the essence to help struggling Americans.

"What more can I do?" That's the question John Lewis asked himself throughout his life and what we must strive to carry on into November and beyond. No matter what we're confronted with, keep marching for justice. \nhttps://t.co/tySngMldDX
Racial inequity touches every aspect of life—from economic justice to environmental justice. Dismantling the very systems that lead to these injustices won't be easy, but it is possible. Standing in solidarity with the #StrikeForBlackLives today.
If Trump and Republicans succeed, this would be a gut-punch for unemployed Americans. \n\nA payroll tax cut doesn't help those who aren't on a payroll, and slashed unemployment benefits won't help people get back on their feet. This should be a nonstarter. \nhttps://t.co/rYd9olZ5us
To honor John Lewis' life and legacy, I'm calling on Mitch McConnell to immediately bring the Voting Rights Advancement Act to the Senate floor for a vote and the Senate should name it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020.
The pandemic has created a looming eviction crisis that could leave millions of renters without a roof over their head. Passing my RELIEF Act is one step to ensuring that doesn't happen. https://t.co/968OsKzchl

Remembering John Lewis' pivotal speech from the March on Washington. He was only 23 then.\nhttps://t.co/XM0QtMjbaI
If Mitch McConnell really wanted to really honor the life, legacy, and activism of John Lewis he'd bring the Voting Rights Act immediately to the Senate floor for a vote and name it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020. https://t.co/LNrYozFN1I
John Lewis once said, \"You cannot be afraid to speak up and speak out for what you believe. You have to have courage, raw courage.\" In his memory, let's continue to speak out against injustice and have the courage to make #GoodTrouble.
The world is dimmer this morning without Congressman John Lewis in it.\n\nHe carried the baton of justice until the very end. It's now on us to pick it up and march on. https://t.co/aiRfh7RsfF
John Lewis was an icon who fought with every ounce of his being to advance the cause of civil rights for all Americans. I'm devastated for his family, friends, staff—and all those whose lives he touched.\n\nMy friend, thank you for showing the world what #GoodTrouble looks like. https://t.co/cvG8nSJCW5
With unemployment skyrocketing &amp; so many Americans struggling to make ends meet, our country is facing an eviction &amp; homelessness crisis like never before. Yesterday I announced the RELIEF Act to stop evictions &amp; rent increases for a year to get people through this pandemic.
Six years ago today Eric Garner's last words, "I can't breathe," reverberated across our nation. \n\nSix years later, we're still fighting for accountability and consequence for police brutality—and a national ban on chokeholds. https://t.co/hQUIurxtB3

While Trump is too busy blaming other people for his failures, Americans across our country are facing financial hardships. Joining @chrislhayes on @MSNBC at 8pm ET tonight to discuss my new bill that Congress must pass to help renters during this crisis.
Today I announced the RELIEF Act, a bill to ban evictions and foreclosures for renters and homeowners for a year—and prohibit landlords from raising the rent during this health and economic crisis. \n\nHousing is a human right. It's time we treated it like one.

It has been four months. Four months without any justice for Breonna Taylor's friends and family. \n\nThe police who murdered her in her own home still have not been charged. \n\nDo not forget about her.
This despicable and cruel rule should've never been proposed in the first place. Thanks to everyone who raised their voice and fought back. Because of you, international students can stay. https://t.co/uorDfd4xpz

If we take back the Senate and elect @JoeBiden president, we can address police brutality. Keep our communities safe from gun violence. Act to combat the climate crisis.\n\nBut none of this will be possible if we don't flip the Senate and remove Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader.
As we've seen with the Black maternal health crisis, every day we don't confront the persistent disparities in our health care system could mean the difference between life and death for someone. \n\nNo one should ever go to the doctor and not have their pain taken seriously. https://t.co/Rf50Ujd7Lo
It's been 122 days since Breonna Taylor was murdered in her own home. The officers who killed her are still walking free. I will never stop demanding justice for her family and loved ones.
There are more than 35M people living with a disability who are eligible to vote. But too often voting is inaccessible. This National Disability Voter Registration Week, I'm calling on Congress to pass my VoteSafe Act to make voting in the age of coronavirus accessible for all.
Evictions may soon leave ~28M homeless in the United States. We are on the verge of a wave of evictions if Congress doesn't swiftly act to ban evictions and foreclosures during the pandemic—and pass my bill to provide $2,000 monthly payments. Time is of the essence.

From slavery, Jim Crow laws, and policing, America's history has been defined by two systems of justice. And the result is that Black Americans have been treated as less than human. Passing the Justice in Policing Act is one step to making our justice system more fair for all.
Every American deserves the right to clean, affordable water. Thank you @NAACP_LDF for taking on this crucial fight that has disproportionately affected Detroit's Black &amp; low-income residents.

Breonna Taylor.\nGeorge Floyd.\nElijah McClain.\nAtatiana Jefferson.\nTamir Rice.\n\nFor them, and countless others, there are two systems of justice in America.
Trump commutes the prison sentence of Roger Stone while the officers that killed Breonna Taylor are still free. The two systems of justice in this country must end.
A majority of our teachers already pay for school supplies with their own money. Are they also going to have to pay out of their own pocket for PPE and other necessities to keep themselves and their students safe? https://t.co/0dPTvIq5bi

African Americans and Latinos are 3x as likely to get coronavirus—and 2x more likely to die—than white people.\n\nThis admin tried to hide the disproportionate impact coronavirus has on our communities. This is exactly why I called for a racial disparities task force months ago.

At a coronavirus testing site in New Orleans, tests ran out 5 minutes after the doors opened. In Phoenix, people waited in their cars up to 8 hours to get tested. It's outrageous that in July we still don't have enough tests for everyone who needs it. \nhttps://t.co/tVWmXvJL9p
Our nation has a water safety, affordability, and sustainability crisis. Unless we take bold action, the climate crisis will continue to intensify water scarcity. Last week I introduced the Water for Tomorrow Act to help ensure a future with safe, clean, affordable water for all.

Trump officially withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization in the middle of a global health crisis. \n\nThis move is reckless, short-sighted, and surrenders what was left of America's leadership on the world stage.
My message to Dreamers: no matter what this week brings, I have your back. We will never stop fighting for you.
Horrific. We must not turn a blind eye to the dark, despicable part of our nation's history that is still alive and well today. \nhttps://t.co/wKYKvM99Zx
This despicable and needlessly cruel decision upends the lives of our international students and further tarnishes America's reputation and competitiveness. It's shameful how low this administration will go to distract from Trump's failed pandemic response. https://t.co/b9GHRwPzEk
The Affordable Care Act is benefitting millions of Americans, and its destruction would have a devastating impact on low-income communities, people with preexisting conditions, seniors, and people of color. \n\nYet Trump is actively trying to dismantle the ACA during a pandemic.
After years of Tribal and Native communities &amp; activists fighting against this injustice, today is a huge victory. Together let's keep up the fight to uphold Tribal treaty rights, protect the water we drink &amp; leave our children a more sustainable future.\nhttps://t.co/nJ4tPj1xEy
@KeishaBottoms Keeping you, your husband, and your entire family in my prayers for a swift and easy recovery. Take care.

The speech Thurgood Marshall gave twenty-eight years ago still resonates to this day: "Democracy just cannot flourish amid fear. Liberty cannot bloom amid hate. Justice cannot take root amid rage. America must get to work."
This Independence Day, I'm grateful for our brave service members and those who fight every day for our country's values. Fueled by love and optimism in what we can be, I know we can create a more just and better nation for all.
We cannot overlook the toll this pandemic and existing racial disparities have had on our Black children—and how it could subsequently impact their future. \nhttps://t.co/saQZWMmbm9
We cannot allow giant gig corporations to exempt themselves from providing essential protections and benefits for their workers. I urge Californians to join me in standing with these essential workers by voting NO on Prop 22.
Trump attempted to muzzle public health experts. Repeatedly said coronavirus was \"under control.\" Refused for a long time to wear a mask to ensure people took this threat seriously.\n\nAt a time when Americans are depending on competent leadership, Trump has failed again and again.
No Black girl should ever grow up thinking she's less than because of her hair. This #CROWNDay, let's embrace our natural hair and fight to pass the Crown Act to make it illegal to discriminate against hair texture and styles.
Coronavirus doesn't take holidays off. This weekend please wear a mask, maintain social distancing, and wash your hands. It can save your life, the lives of the people you love, and complete strangers.
Our Justice in Policing Act will:\n→Expand independent investigations into police misconduct \n→Establish a national police misconduct registry\n→Require states to report use of force incidents\n→Set a national standard for use of force\n→Ban no-knock warrants in drug cases

1 in 1,500 Black Americans has died from coronavirus.\n\nThis pandemic is further reinforcing historic inequities we've had in our nation long before we ever heard the word "coronavirus." Confronting these disparities must be at the forefront.

Coronavirus has killed nearly 130,000 Americans.\nWe were warned the U.S. could see 100,000 new cases a day. \nYet there is still no adequate national testing strategy.\n\nIt could not be more clear: Trump has surrendered to this virus and abandoned Americans.

Rent is due today and countless Americans don't know how they're going to make ends meet this month. \n\nA one-time payment wasn't nearly enough. We can't wait any longer to pass my bill to provide $2,000 every month throughout this pandemic.
After 109 days and no justice, I say Breonna Taylor's name. I say the names of Sandra Bland, Atatiana Jefferson, Aiyana Jones, and the countless others who were killed by police or who died in police custody. We will continue to demand change in their honor.
