This is what voter suppression looks like. In the year 2020, people shouldn't have to wait in line for 5 hours to exercise a constitutional right to vote. We need federal law which respects democracy and makes it easy to vote in every state and end all forms of voter suppression. https://t.co/07ReQPK5kH
On #PrimeDay, let's not forget. During the pandemic, Jeff Bezos became $97 billion richer by increasing prices by up to 1,000% on essential items and denying hazard pay and paid sick leave to over 450,000 of his workers. It's time to break up Amazon and tax the rich.

I know some of you are thinking of sitting this election out. Let me tell you why that is not an option. https://t.co/dNQpyHlSRf
During this pandemic 215,000 Americans have died and 12 million lost health care. Meanwhile, billionaires in the health care industry became $150 billion richer. The function of a rational health care system is to guarantee quality care for all, not make the rich even richer.
The Native American people must be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve. We all must stand with them in the fight improve their quality of life and to protect their treaties and tribal rights. #IndigenousPeoplesDay

Ten weeks ago, 30 million unemployed workers stopped receiving $600/week in benefits because the Senate GOP thought $600 was too generous. Since then, the 4 richest Americans gained $54 billion and now own $524 billion in wealth. We need an economy that works for all, not the 1%.
Let's be clear. It would be much less expensive to enact the Green New Deal than it would be to continue to allow the fossil fuel industry to destroy the planet we live on. And it would create millions of good-paying jobs in the process.

Wealth of U.S. billionaires in 2009: $1.3 trillion\n\nWealth of U.S. billionaires in 2020: $3.6 trillion\n\nMinimum wage in 2009: $7.25/hr\n\nMinimum wage in 2020: $7.25/hr\n\nYes. We need to increase the minimum wage to $15/hr, tax the wealth of billionaires and expand Medicare to All.
In the last few days Trump has been for a stimulus package, against it, and for it. What will the \"stable genius\" say next? All I know is every unemployed worker needs $600 a week. Working class families need $2,000 a month. And every American needs the same health care as Trump.
While Trump received over $100,000 in free government health care for himself, he's attempting to throw 20 million Americans off their health care. Yes. Trump, the self-proclaimed billionaire, believes in government help for himself, but rugged individualism for everyone else.
This is what an irrational economy looks like. Billionaires get richer &amp; pay less in taxes while millions are unemployed, kids go hungry, veterans sleep on the street. We must stand up to the billionaire class and create an economy for all, not just a few. https://t.co/GR5VEZoOcp

After receiving the best socialized health care in the world Trump just said \"no\" to providing any relief to the unemployed, the uninsured or the hungry. But he's still pushing the Senate to confirm a Supreme Court nominee who will strip health care from 20 million. How pathetic.
Mr. President: You attack "socialized medicine" every single day. Well, let's be clear. The excellent care you received at Walter Reed was at a 100% government-funded, government run hospital. For Trump, \"socialized medicine\" is bad for everyone but himself. Total hypocrisy!
West Virginians deserve a voice in Congress who will look out for the working class and address their economic pain. When @Kunkel4Congress gets to Washington, that is exactly what she will do. https://t.co/deJMYO7cti
I believe every person in America is entitled to the same health care as the President of the United States—with no co-pays, no deductibles and no out-of-pocket expenses. If government-funded health care is good enough for Trump, it is good enough for all of us as a human right.
In addition, voting sites are opening today near three colleges: East Lansing near MSU, on campus at Western Michigan University and Northern Michigan University. Detroit is also opening 21 early voting sites across the city which will be open 7 days a week until Election Day.

With Joe Biden as president and a Democratic Congress, we will:\n\n-⬆️ the minimum wage to $15/hr\n- Make public colleges tuition-free for working families\n- Substantially reduce student debt\n- Lower the age for Medicare to 60\n- Improve Medicare to include dental, vision &amp; hearing

This election isn't just Trump vs. Biden. It's: \n\nTrump vs. Democracy\nTrump vs. Science\nTrump vs. A $15/hr minimum wage\nTrump vs. Universal childcare\nTrump vs. Expanding health care\nTrump vs. Making college available to all\n\nDespair is not an option. Too much is at stake.
Last night Trump was asked to condemn white supremacy—and refused. He has called neo-Nazis \"very fine people.\" He has inspired disgusting acts of racism and violence. This is the most dangerous president in the modern history of our country. He must be defeated.
The business model on Wall Street is fraud. It's not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. There will not be justice on Wall Street until we make it clear that no bank is too big too fail and no Wall Street CEO is too big to jail. https://t.co/CdyzxKg0ko
While Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2017, the 139 trips he has taken to his country clubs as president cost American taxpayers $141 million. Yes. This is a president who believes in corporate socialism if you're a billionaire and rugged capitalism for the rest.
While Donald Trump paid just $750 in U.S. federal income taxes during the first year of his presidency, he paid over $317,000 in taxes to India, Panama and the Philippines. How's that for America first?
Trump is either:\n\nA) A bad businessman who has lost money year after year after year. \nB) A tax cheat who has avoided paying what he owes in taxes year after year after year. \n\nKnowing Donald Trump, both are probably true. https://t.co/CMpgpJeZ7b

Trump and his allies are doing everything possible to suppress the vote and undermine American democracy.  That is what authoritarians do. They must not be allowed to succeed. Let us stand together, have the largest voter turnout in American history and send Trump packing.
What a hypocrite! While Trump makes hateful &amp; racist rants about how immigrants are "bad" for the country, the undocumented immigrants he hired to work at his country clubs paid more in federal income taxes than Trump. What's bad for the country? Billionaires who don't pay taxes.
Leona Helmsley, multi-billionaire hotel heiress: \"Only the little people pay taxes\" \n\nYep:\n\nTrump paid no income taxes in 10/15 years\nAmazon paid no income taxes in 3 years\nBillionaires pay lower tax rate than the middle class\nTop 1% avoided $800 billion in taxes \n\n#TaxTheRich
Trump's tax returns tell us that he's either a very bad businessman or a tax cheat—likely both.\n\nBut more importantly, it shows how the wealthy, unlike most Americans, are able to avoid paying taxes.\n\nThe top 1% is responsible for 70% of unpaid taxes.\n\nIt's time to tax the rich.
The election is 36 days away. The American people should have their say in that election before Mitch McConnell pushes through a lifelong appointment to the Supreme Court.
Shock of shocks! Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed billionaire, received a $72.9 million tax refund from the IRS while not paying a nickel in federal income taxes in 10 out of 15 years. \n\nYep. Trump l-o-v-e-s corporate socialism for himself, rugged capitalism for everyone else.
What the Senate should approve:\n\n-$600/week for 30 million unemployed workers\n-$2,000 a month for working class Americans\n-An emergency expansion of Medicare to all\n\nWhat the Senate should not approve:\n\nA Supreme Court nominee before Inauguration Day.

In the United States the president does not determine who can or cannot vote and what ballots will be counted.\n\nThat may be what is done in other authoritarian countries.\n\nBut it is not and will not be done in America.\n\nThis is a democracy.
Do not assume enough people will turn out to vote to defeat Trump and that you can stay home.\n\nEvery vote matters.\n\nMake a plan to vote right now. https://t.co/vMkvkrfLu1
Trump promised to stand up for rural Americans. He lied. \n\nWe must defeat him and fight for an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families. \n\nJoin our town hall tomorrow at 1 p.m. ET with @PplsAction. RSVP at https://t.co/ftVFOMLw0d.
Yes. Trump is moving us in an authoritarian direction. But despair is not an option. We must take action to preserve American democracy. https://t.co/Jiu5BZdT39
The American people, no matter what their political persuasion, must make it clear that American democracy will not be destroyed. https://t.co/xP4AYQnvnB

Trump's strategy to delegitimize this election and to stay in office if he loses is not complicated. Finding himself behind in many polls, he is attempting massive voter suppression. https://t.co/0Vi4UpBMIs
To my Republican colleagues in the Congress, please do not continue to tell the American people how much you love America if, at this critical moment, you are not prepared to stand up to defend American democracy and our way of life. \n\nStop the hypocrisy. https://t.co/MWXHCLLgpq

I understand that Donald Trump was born to a very wealthy family and, from his earliest days, was able to get anything he wanted.\n\nBut let me make this clear to Donald Trump: Too many people have fought and died to defend American democracy.\n\nYou are not going to destroy it. https://t.co/NtxzDubf6i

The United States is the oldest continuous democracy in the modern world.\n\nWe held elections in the middle of the Civil War, during the Great Depression and during World War II.\n\nBut today, under Trump, that peaceful transition of power is being threatened like never before. https://t.co/b422jTpXGF
This is not just an election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. This is an election between Donald Trump and democracy – and democracy must win. https://t.co/bi1BiS2hdt
For the first time, we are facing an election where it is not clear that a sitting president will voluntarily leave office if he loses. Watch my live address on what we must do to prepare for Trump's unique threat to our democracy: https://t.co/7iVunrmo8h
This election is about more than Democrat vs. Republican. It is about democracy vs. authoritarianism. I'll be addressing Trump's threat to our nation today at 1 p.m. ET at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/lHd0WJwRMI
This is what an authoritarian sounds like.\n\nTomorrow, at 1 p.m. ET, I will be delivering an address on the unprecedented and dangerous moment we are in right now given President Trump's unique threats to our democracy.\n\nWatch at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/DEJvT1NJz9
"In a three mile radius — Cambridge, home to MIT and Harvard, to Roxbury, the blackest part of my district, life expectancy drops by 30 years… These health care injustices are not naturally occurring. They are legislated." –@AyannaPressley https://t.co/8MTwx2ANUV
\"Medicare for All would have fundamentally changed America's experience with COVID-19.\" –@AbdulElSayed https://t.co/5iqxKGHZ91
\"How differently America would have reacted to the pandemic if we already had Medicare for All. Every other industrialized country realized a long time ago that health care can't be tied to employment, that it needs to be guaranteed to everyone." –@PramilaJayapal https://t.co/9aScFr32PJ
\"In a for-profit, employer-based [health care] system, people get left in the cold and out in the dark.\" –@FlyingWithSara https://t.co/Pr2fjotK9K
Simple question: will we continue to allow health care to be treated as a commodity, or will we ensure it is a human right? https://t.co/A3L0H0FFdA
Health care is a human right. The fight for Medicare for All continues. Join me, @Public_Citizen, and many great panelists for a town hall on achieving health justice for all: https://t.co/y6Y09r3sA2
Health care is a human right. \n\nJoin me, @Public_Citizen and many excellent panelists tonight at 8 p.m. ET for a town hall on achieving health care justice for all. \n\nhttps://t.co/wtFmw8Hk41 https://t.co/DwqTAcSDil
What we must do now: \n\n➡️Ensure Biden wins in a landslide\n\n➡️Hold Congressional hearings on how local officials plan to handle Election Day processes\n\n➡️State legislatures must allow votes to be counted as they come in\n\n➡️Help Americans understand we may not know results on Nov 3
Never in this country's history have we failed to have a peaceful transition of power from one president to the next. We must do all we can to make sure Trump isn't the first. In this election the future of American democracy is at stake. We must not lose.\nhttps://t.co/Z8z2I7cYfQ
Breonna Taylor's life mattered. This result is a disgrace and an abdication of justice. Our criminal justice system is racist. The time for fundamental change is now. https://t.co/IPmO9upXbK
Trump promised to protect rural Americans. He lied, and bailed out the billionaire class instead.\n\nJoin our town hall this weekend with @PplsAction on fighting for rural America and how we must defeat Trump in November.\n\nTune in Saturday at 1 p.m. ET at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/qm3eFTX4mA
I am 79, and I am angry.\n\nIf I were 18 or 20, I would be very, very, very angry.\n\nYoung people can transform this country. We must do everything we can to ensure they vote in this election. https://t.co/RIeUyphJ2o
"When [Latinos] went out and voted in 2018, we changed a Congress that looked more like America — the most Latinas, the most women, the most LGBTQ+, the most people that believed in science when it comes to climate change." –@MariaTeresa1 https://t.co/PztFPdQAAn
\"It's Trump first, not America first. He has hooked up his billionaire friends and donors, and he has excused and encouraged cruelty to our communities… He may think he's running the country like a reality show, but it's our lives." –@marisa_franco https://t.co/epvy3ap5rJ
\"We cannot allow [Trump] to continue facilitating deaths in attacking the immigrant community, in abusing Puerto Ricans… We need to transform those frustrations into the power and the fuel that will take us out to the polls." –@thaiscarrero https://t.co/KVR9hJH9tt
There is a reason why our death rate per capita in terms of COVID-19 is much higher than almost any other country. We have a president who from the beginning downplayed this pandemic and who is at war with science, doctors and researchers. https://t.co/bJ6if5WSkS
\"We have a very strong story to tell, as Democrats, to the Latino community.\" –@JulianCastro https://t.co/0PbJdMz10K
We have to develop strong policies that speak to the needs of the Latino community and reach out specifically to Latino voters to bring them into the political process. https://t.co/kAkihMHiSZ
The stakes of this November's election could not be higher, and now is a time for us all to get involved and create the nation we can become. Join me now for a live town hall with @JulianCastro and more, presented by @UniNoticias. https://t.co/oYGYQFwRiM

The Trump administration awarded:\n\n➡️$183 million to companies like Rolls-Royce to build more warships\n➡️$155 million to Boeing &amp; General Electric for more fighter jets\n➡10s of millions for more drones\n\nAll this money was meant to be used for more masks and tests.\n\nDisgusting. https://t.co/6NpdX8XzEF

I'm proud to endorse @Bradshaw2020's grassroots campaign. Marquita is building a strong grassroots movement by standing up to big-money politics and challenging the status quo. I believe her bold, progressive movement, powered by the people, can make history in Tennessee. https://t.co/U5asEvEPYk

She is a fighter for Medicare for All and understands that the Green New Deal will not only combat climate change but will create good-paying jobs. I'm proud to endorse her. https://t.co/a8RyIBp4aY
Here's a radical idea. Instead of arresting poor Americans — disproportionately African American and Latino — for possessing marijuana, let's start prosecuting the crooks on Wall Street for laundering money for drug cartels, suspected terrorists and corrupt foreign officials.

This election is not just about Democrat vs. Republican. It is about democracy vs. authoritarianism.
After the 2016 election, Trump said that "millions of people voted illegally."\n\nThat's when he won.\n\nWhat will he say in 2020 if he loses?\n\nWe need to understand and be prepared for the fact that Trump will do whatever it takes to maintain the power of the presidency.
This is what authoritarianism looks like. An American president does not praise violence against a reporter for doing his job. That is what an ugly, insecure two-bit dictator does. The future of our democracy and a free press is at stake this election. We must defeat Trump badly. https://t.co/VkfxN5NL7T
This is what Senator Lindsey Graham, the current Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said back in 2018. Let's see if he has an ounce of integrity left and will keep his word. https://t.co/VKk6M6jScA
The passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a tremendous loss to our country. She was an extraordinary champion of justice and equal rights, and will be remembered as one of the great justices in modern American history.
This election is between a corrupt president who got $200,000 a year from his dad's empire starting at the age of three and a candidate who grew up in a working class family. https://t.co/BpAZMry4Te
Mail in voter fraud rate: 0.0025%.\n\nNumber of lies Trump has made since he has been president: Over 20,000 and counting.\n\nWe don't have a problem with mail-in voting fraud. We have a problem with a president who is a pathological liar and is actively trying to suppress the vote.
The Trump administration's handling of the pandemic has been an utter, deadly disaster.\n\nSending each American 5 high-quality masks would have saved tens of thousands of lives.\n\nThe good news: if implemented now, it still could. My Masks for All legislation would do just that. https://t.co/SOc49qbSRo
Trump has to stop this nonsense about mail-in ballots being fraudulent.\n\nEvery vote cast in this country must be counted. https://t.co/oenqAGg7mN
In-person early voting starts today in:\n\n➡️Virginia\n➡️Minnesota\n➡️South Dakota\n➡️Wyoming\n\nLet's stand together. Let's defeat Trump. Let's defend democracy. Find your voting information now: https://t.co/Q11p3BUgIQ
At a time when the 1% and corporations are gaining more and more wealth, we have got to invest in working people who are severely hurting during this crisis. Congratulations to New Jersey on this important step forward. https://t.co/6LFtbgPzDy
Joe Biden is absolutely right: No worker should make less than $15/hr. When we defeat Trump and elect progressives to Congress, not only will we raise the minimum wage to $15/hr—we'll create millions of jobs and raise wages for all by expanding unions. https://t.co/Lqcf7bjHc8
The time is now for a Green New Deal and bold action on climate. Join @sunrisemvmt leaders to discuss the stakes of this moment and what people around the country can do to organize and stop more climate-fueled devastation. https://t.co/qstw7oPZzU
Thousands of taxi workers are struggling to put food on the table because of the greed of predatory lenders and massive rideshare companies. I stand with @NYTWA taking action today—the debt of these workers must be forgiven now. https://t.co/hZJNCBFXsv
During the past 6 months of the pandemic, while 30 million Americans lost jobs, 12 million lost health insurance and 40 million face eviction, the richest 15 Americans gained an obscene $400 billion in wealth. It is time to tell the billionaire class that they cannot have it all.
Let me congratulate the nurses in Asheville, North Carolina, for the largest union victory in the South since 1975. What the nurses in Asheville demonstrated is that when you stand together, when you fight back against corporate greed, justice and dignity will prevail. https://t.co/H0DC5mL0X2
The Green New Deal is not too expensive. What is far more expensive is allowing our planet to burn up, lives lost, and homes destroyed because of the endless greed of a handful of fossil fuel executives.
When Trump talks about \"herd immunity\" he shows his ineptness, is surrendering to the pandemic and is sentencing hundreds of thousands more Americans to death. Whether it's climate change or the pandemic we need a president who believes in science — and that's not Trump. https://t.co/9KRxFmBKFa
All that we're talking about in this election is the future of our democracy, the future of our economy, the future of our health care system—and oh, by the way, the future of the planet.\n\nOther than that, not much is at stake.
.@karaforcongress is facing the same incumbent Republican she came within just 1.9% of defeating two years ago while running on a strong progressive platform that prioritizes the needs of working people in Omaha and beyond. Let's make sure Kara is elected to Congress this year. https://t.co/kEINTeFRRC
.@audrey4congress is an educator and farmer who understands the challenges facing working people in Northern California. She has pledged not to accept corporate PAC contributions, and has run her campaign focusing on many of the same issues that are central to our movement. https://t.co/7wReygtJRE
.@Kunkel4Congress knows West Virginians are ready for a political and economic system that works for all, not just the wealthy. When she gets to Washington, she'll take on inequality, the climate crisis, and the health care crisis, and I hope to serve with her in Congress soon. https://t.co/uaYzN4HkmW

We can no longer tolerate a system that allows a billionaire like Elon Musk to gain $10.3 billion in one day, while 30 million unemployed workers are denied $600 a week to pay the rent and put food on the table. We need an economy that works for all, not just the 1%. #TaxTheRich
At a time of unprecedented economic pain and suffering the do-nothing Senate must pass:\n\n- $600 a week for the unemployed\n- $2,000 a month for the working class\n- An emergency expansion of Medicare to all\n- Hazard pay for essential workers\n- $25 billion for the Postal Service
In the midst of a global pandemic and a climate crisis, we cannot continue having a president who rejects science. We have 49 days to go before Election Day. Let us defeat Trump, elect progressives and reverse the incredible damage that has been done to our nation.
These reports are simply horrifying. They must be investigated by Congress and anyone responsible must be held accountable for these disturbing acts. We must dismantle ICE and CBP and create an immigration system based on justice, not cruelty and human rights violations. https://t.co/N9tDFN5V5X
The United States of America is the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care, paid family and medical leave, paid sick days and a paid vacation. That is not a \"family value.\" That is an assault on what a family values. Let us end this international embarrassment.
Since 1975, there has been a h-u-g-e redistribution of income in America, but it has gone in the wrong direction. Over the past 45 years, $50 trillion has been taken out of the pockets of the bottom 90% and into the hands of the top 1%—costing the median worker $42,000 a year.
Unbelievably—as the West Coast burns amidst record-breaking temperature—Trump continues to deny the reality of climate change. Despite his delusions we must take on the fossil fuel industry &amp; transform our energy system to sustainable energy. The future of the planet is at stake. https://t.co/dFWefye5xX
It's outrageous for Big Pharma to use the pandemic as an opportunity to raise prices on life-saving medicine.\n\nNo, Mr. President.\n\nWe don't need phony executive orders that do nothing to lower drug prices.\n\nBig drug companies don't need more subsidies. We need to end their greed. https://t.co/NTnUVMlurt
Tens of millions of Americans are facing hunger, eviction and joblessness. They are frightened that they will soon lose their homes to eviction and not be able to feed their families. We cannot abandon them. Every working class American needs $2,000 a month until the crisis ends.
If Biden is president &amp; we have a Democratic Congress we will:\n\n- ⬆️the minimum wage to $15/hr\n- ⬇️the Medicare age to 60\n- Create millions of jobs rebuilding America\n- Make public colleges tuition-free for working families\n- Enact 12 weeks of paid family leave\n- Adopt equal pay
There are people in Washington who say the Green New Deal is too expensive and we can't afford it.\n\nWhat is the alternative? \n\nA planet which is burning up? https://t.co/PklRTmPG9j
Unless we successfully combat climate change, the terrible wildfires we are seeing will only get worse in the future — as will droughts, floods and extreme weather disturbances. \n\nNo excuses.\n\nWe need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel NOW and save the planet.
Not only do we have to beat Trump. This is wealthiest country in the history of the world. We can and we must guarantee all our people a decent standard of living. https://t.co/tvds84pzJW
"COVID-19 has killed more than 6,000 people in Michigan and has killed 23 people in my life personally.

Endless wars have cost $6.4 trillion.\n\nTax breaks for the top 1% &amp; corporations cost over $1 trillion.\n\nWe are now spending $740 billion a year on the military - more than the next 11 nations combined.\n\nPlease don't tell me we can't afford Medicare for All or the Green New Deal.
Today we remember the 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and the heroism of the first responders who risked their lives for others. We must not only recognize that loss but end the endless wars that we have waged since that attack which have caused immeasurable harm for nearly two decades.

We can no longer tolerate an economic system that allows 467 billionaires to increase their wealth by $800,000,000,000 during a pandemic, while 150,000,000 Americans are facing serious financial problems and 30,000,000 people in our country don't have enough food to eat.

If we can afford to give a $1 trillion tax break to the top 1% and large corporations and $740 billion to the Pentagon, please don't tell me we cannot afford to provide $2,000 a month to the working class, $600 a week to unemployed workers and expand Medicare to all.

As we celebrate Labor Day let us not forget that in recent months, while the very rich have grown much richer, tens of millions of workers have lost their jobs, and many families are now struggling to put food on the table and avoid eviction. Congress must act to protect workers.
Strong unions mean decent wages and a strong middle class.\n\nCongress must make it easier for workers to join unions and engage in collective bargaining.\n\nWe must end the heavy-handed corporate tactics that prevent workers from unionizing.
On this Labor Day we must pledge to end starvation wages in America. Raising the minimum wage to at least $15 per hour will give 40 million workers a long overdue pay raise, and a shred of human dignity.
On this Labor Day let us not forget that over the last 30 years the top 1% have seen a $22 trillion increase in their wealth, while the bottom half of the American people have actually seen a decline in their wealth. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few.
As we celebrate Labor Day I want to thank all of America's workers for what you do.\n\nThank you to all of the essential workers who are quite literally putting their lives on the line.\n\nLet us create an economy that works for all, and not just the few. #LaborDay2020
Labor Day weekend is not only a time to thank workers. It is also a time to reflect on how the working class of this country is doing and where we want to be in the future. https://t.co/hzQgsD5Z96
Today, I say to Mitch McConnell: Do your job. Let us pass the HEROES Act or legislation that is even better. But, for once in your life, stop worrying about your billionaire campaign contributors, and respond to the needs of working families.

Today we have to come together in a united front and say to this president: Sorry, too many people fought and died to preserve this democracy. You're not going to destroy it. https://t.co/SofrhUDFNc
Let us work hard to deliver Joe Biden an overwhelming victory on election night. But, we must also stay vigilant, and do everything possible to prevent Trump from staying in power if he loses. Nothing less than our democracy is at stake.
Fourth, we need Congressional hearings with local officials to learn how they plan to handle the Election Day process and the days that follow. Every agency of government—federal, state and local—must do everything possible to ensure that we have a free and fair election.
Third, social media companies must finally get their act together and stop people from using their tools to threaten and harass election officials, spread disinformation, and organize voter intimidation and disinformation on their sites.
Second, the news media needs to prepare the American people to understand there is no longer a single Election Day and that we may not know the results on November 3. Absent a national conversation about that reality, conspiracy theories and disinformation will likely thrive.
First, with the pandemic and a massive increase in mail-in voting, state legislatures must take action to allow votes to be counted before Election Day. We must avoid a situation where battleground states are counting millions of votes for days and weeks after Election Day.
We must do everything we can to ensure @JoeBiden wins by the largest possible margin. We also must consider what happens if Trump loses but refuses to abide by the results and does everything he can to hold onto power.
Tomorrow at 2 p.m. ET, join our live Labor Day weekend town hall on how we must stand up to Trump and build worker power across the country. Tune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/x5BWIkE1LY
This is shocking, even for Trump. The men and women who lost their lives defending our country are patriots – not "losers" and "suckers." Trump must be defeated and defeated badly.\nhttps://t.co/f8Gk72J8KD
If there's going to be class war in this country it's time the working class won that war. Tomorrow at 12 p.m. ET I will deliver an address honoring working Americans this Labor Day weekend. Tune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/IqMTewLVFj
There are issues where Joe Biden and I agree, and issues where we disagree.\n\nBut his economic agenda will finally begin to address some of the real crises facing working families. https://t.co/SxrquS3Hdw
It's a national disgrace that families are being evicted from their homes and thrown on the street. We must not only suspend evictions, foreclosures, and utility shut-offs. We must cancel rent and mortgage payments until the crisis is over.
Daniel Prude should be alive today. The officers responsible for his horrific death must be fired, arrested and prosecuted. There must be a DOJ investigation into his death and any deaths that occur in police custody. Period. https://t.co/DaTIGdIfaq
For years, Donald Trump has lied about \"voter fraud.\" Now he proceeds to tell the people of North Carolina to commit a felony by voting twice. This is not a president who believes in democracy. He is an authoritarian who must be defeated.
This Labor Day Weekend, join our virtual forum on the movement to expand workers' rights and fight back against Trump's efforts to dismantle union power. Tune in at 2 p.m. ET on Saturday at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/iNTd2v9yTK
At a time of pandemic, economic meltdown and climate change, it is easy to forget that Trump is now working to defund and destroy Social Security—a longtime Republican dream. No. We will defeat you and expand Social Security, the most successful anti-poverty program in history.
This Saturday, join my virtual Vermont town hall, featuring @zuckermanforvt and other guests, to discuss the challenges facing Vermonters heading into the election. Tune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS at 4 p.m. ET. https://t.co/IXYp7IKIot
It's no great secret that Joe Biden and I disagree on a number of issues. But there's no question that the economic proposals Joe Biden is supporting are strong and will go a long, long way in improving life for working families. We must elect him and throw Trump out of office. https://t.co/wjJF1pPrTn
The mainstream media doesn't talk about it.\n\nCongress doesn't talk about it.\n\nTrump doesn't talk about it.\n\nBut three multi-billionaires now own more wealth than the bottom half of our society.\n\nThat level of inequality is immoral and unsustainable.
In the richest country on Earth no one should suddenly lose their health insurance, let alone during a pandemic. It's outrageous that our corporate-run system treats health insurance as an employee benefit, not a right. We must end that disgrace and pass Medicare for All. https://t.co/pFR93cNCm6
Trump claims he's a \"law and order\" president. That's funny. This is a president who shamelessly violates the Constitution, incites violence, uses his office to enrich his family, and seven of his top campaign advisers have been criminally charged (so far). Trump must go.
Mr. President, your job is to discourage violence, not incite it.
Trump's proposal to permanently terminate the payroll tax could defund Social Security and eliminate benefits for senior citizens and people with disabilities in &lt;4 years. That's not Bernie Sanders talking. That's what the Social Security Administration recently reported to us.
Three months ago the House responded to the enormous pain and suffering of the American people by passing a $3.5 trillion relief package.\n\nWhat has McConnell and the Republican-led Senate done since then?\n\nNothing except pass a bloated Pentagon budget and take a vacation.
Young people: your generation holds the future of the nation in your hands. If young people voted at the same rate as older people, we could transform this country. https://t.co/jLgf1HKrVq
"This pandemic has not affected all of us equally. It is absolutely decimating Latino communities, decimating African American families and the families of Native Americans.\" -@BetoORourke https://t.co/aQ3M5iFgS9
.@JosePGarza is right—the spread of coronavirus in prisons is a devastating crisis that must be addressed. https://t.co/kejOPHQg3x
Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs. Senate Republicans go on vacation. Join me now with @BetoORourke, @JulieOliverTX, @JosePGarza and more to demand Republicans pass relief now. https://t.co/j6Y259Crg8
We have a president today who is an authoritarian and who is trying to undermine our democracy. https://t.co/S1z8l4MUs1
Mitch McConnell, end your vacation. 30 million Americans say they don't have enough to eat. Millions more are facing eviction. Join us now for a town hall with Coloradans as we demand Senate Republicans get back to work to protect American families. https://t.co/V16lmfxIj1
Starting soon: join our town halls today at 1 pm and 3 pm ET featuring leaders, activists, and candidates in Colorado and Texas to discuss how we must tackle the crises we face and hold Republicans accountable.\n\nTune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/wHnVMLKXVI
Donald Trump has repeatedly stated, including just the other night, that the economy before the pandemic was the greatest it had ever been in history and he did it all. I don't want to shock anybody, but what Donald Trump said was a lie. https://t.co/hwE3Y3lIuS
Trump is a fraud and a liar. He promised to help working people. Instead, he works for the billionaire class. We must elect @JoeBiden and start moving our economy in the right direction. Watch my live address now:  https://t.co/6UBqnV2nve
At 12 p.m. ET I will be delivering an address on how President Trump has betrayed American workers, and what must be done if we are to improve the economy for ordinary Americans, and not just the wealthy. Tune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/wWANFta1UH
Our thoughts are with Chadwick Boseman's family and loved ones and all the fans he inspired with his spirit and groundbreaking performances.
Today, 57 years since hundreds of thousands of people came together for the #MarchOnWashington for Jobs and Freedom, the struggle continues. Thank you to the many, many people who are showing up and carrying forward the fight for racial justice.
Mr. President, if you believe in the American people and our way of life so much, tell them tonight that you are prepared to leave office when you lose. Democracy – that's what America is about. #PromisesBroken
Mr. President, if you love the American people so much, why are you trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our gender, our country of origin and our religion? #PromisesBroken
Yes, this is the most important election in history. And you are the most dangerous president in the history of our country. That's why you're going to lose. #PromisesBroken
Trump promised he would provide \"health insurance to everybody.\" But he is now in court actively trying to take health insurance away from 32 million Americans and eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions during a global pandemic. #PromisesBroken
One more lie. Trump's budget cuts Medicare by $845 billion and he promised to defund Social Security by permanently terminating the payroll tax. #PromisesBroken
According to documented sources, Trump has made 20,000 lies and distortions while in office, and that is before this speech. Will he ever stop lying to the American people? #PromisesBroken
I don't know if this is a record, maybe the last "Law and Order" president Richard Nixon beat it, but seven of Trump's top campaign advisers have been criminally charged … so far. #PromisesBroken
400,000 Americans should not be kept in jail for the "crime" of being poor and unable to afford bail. #PromisesBroken
Yes, Mr. President, it is the women of this country who control their own bodies, not you. #PromisesBroken
Here is the Trump manifesto: a government of lies, corruption, greed and rejection of science. #PromisesBroken
Trump promised that "the rich would not be gaining at all" under his tax plan. But the tax bill he signed into law provides 83% of the benefits to the top 1% while raising taxes on 92 million Americans by the end of the decade. #PromisesBroken
Stop the lies. Doctors and nurses today still don't have the masks, gowns and gloves they need to protect themselves and our lives. #PromisesBroken
Yes, Trump wants to spend billions on a Space Force, but half a million Americans are homeless and 45 million Americans have student debt. Let's get our priorities right. Invest in working Americans, Mr. President. #PromisesBroken
In Michigan, there are 57,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than when Trump took office.\n\nIn Wisconsin, there are 11,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than when Trump took office.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, there are today 25,000 less manufacturing jobs than when Trump took office. #PromisesBroken
Trump: Abraham Lincoln. \nFox: News.
Trump took away the legal rights of the 1.8 million young people eligible for DACA. That is an outrage. Those rights must be restored. #PromisesBroken
This is a president who said he was going to \"drain the swamp,\" but has used his office for blatant personal and political gain, running the most corrupt administration in modern American history. #PromisesBroken
Trump just LOVES socialism when it's his family feeding at the trough for $885 million in government subsidies and tax breaks to build a real-estate empire on racial discrimination. #PromisesBroken
Trump's rejection of science has contributed to the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. We need a president who believes in science. #PromisesBroken
Remember the state of the economy before the pandemic?\n\nHalf of Americans lived paycheck to paycheck\n40% of adults didn't have $400 for an emergency\n87 million uninsured or underinsured\n41 million workers made under $15/hour\n\nNope. That was not a \"great economy.\"\n\n#PromisesBroken
At a time when California is on fire, when Hurricane Laura is doing devastating harm, when is Trump going to get to the part when he tells us that climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese? #PromisesBroken
We have a president whose contempt for the law is so clear that he holds a political rally at the White House. #PromisesBroken
We need to protect our democracy and stop the slide into oligarchy. Join @JulieOliverTX, @RepRoKhanna, @ZephyrTeachout, and @Tiffany_Muller for a live roundtable about getting corporate money out of politics: https://t.co/kyRxObpHoB
Trump has betrayed the working people of this country and our job tonight, and in the next 68 days, is to expose him for the fraud and pathological liar that he is. I hope to see you while I live-tweet his speech later tonight. #PromisesBroken
Trump promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. That was another whopper. His budgets proposed slashing all three and his "payroll tax holiday" is designed to bankrupt Social Security and Medicare. #PromisesBroken
Trump said he'd stand up for working families, yet today the rich are getting much richer and there is more income and wealth inequality than any time since the 1920s. Three people now own more wealth than the bottom half of our nation. #PromisesBroken
Trump promised to provide health care "to everyone," yet has tried to throw 32 million people off their health insurance. Today, millions more people have no health insurance than when Trump came into office. #PromisesBroken
Let the prebuttal begin! Watching Trump tonight will be hard because you just can't keep up with all the lies. But I will be watching and live-tweeting, hoping he will apologize to the American people for his #PromisesBroken.
It's unacceptable that the 4 richest men in the U.S. now own a record-breaking $542 billion in wealth while 92 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured. It's time to tax the windfall profits of these billionaires and expand Medicare to all.
I strongly support the NBA, WNBA and MLB players who are striking for racial justice. Real change takes place when people come together and demand it. It is time for the police who shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back to be fired, arrested and prosecuted. Now.
Hurricane Laura producing an unsurvivable storm surge in Texas and Louisiana. A catastrophic 800-mile derecho in Iowa and Illinois. Raging wildfires in California. No. The Green New Deal is not radical. Having a president in office who calls climate change a hoax—that's radical.
When Trump says \"America will never become a socialist country,\" remember: his New York real estate empire would be worth nothing without $885 million in government grants, subsidies and tax breaks. Trump l-o-v-e-s corporate socialism for himself, rugged capitalism for the rest.
Join me this Saturday for two more town halls featuring leaders, activists, and candidates in Colorado and Texas to discuss how we must tackle the crises we face and hold Republicans accountable.\n\nTune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/2u7lZLgIuk
During the last campaign, candidate Trump promised the American people he would not cut Social Security. We now know that was a lie. No, Mr. President. We will not let you defund Social Security. We are going to sweep you out of office and we are going to expand Social Security. https://t.co/SosH1SiHjw
No more tear gas, no more pepper spray, no more rubber bullets on protestors. Ban them all.\nhttps://t.co/TYP5PfXgNI
Remember: A year after Trump's tax plan was signed into law, 91 corporations paid nothing in federal incomes taxes after making billions in profits, including:\n\nAmazon\nNetflix\nGeneral Motors\nChevron\nFedEx\nEli Lilly\nStarbucks\nWhirlpool\n\nTrump's tax plan was a giveaway to the rich.
We must come together to defeat Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president.\n\nMy friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine. https://t.co/otqxn1SPR4
Trump said he would stand with working families,\n\nhe said he would "drain the swamp,"\n\nhe said he'd provide health care to everybody,\n\nhe said he'd protect Medicare and Social Security.\n\nYou can see now that he is a fraud and he lied to all of us. https://t.co/eonLbBhPoY
Never forget. While Trump and the Republican Senate denied hazard pay to essential workers, their tax plan allowed Amazon to pay nothing in federal income taxes after making $29 billion in profits. Yes. Trump loves socialism for the rich, rugged capitalism for everyone else.
This is not just an election on the issues. This is an election on the future of American democracy. https://t.co/9vOtftuA15
We must fight back against Trump's efforts to destroy USPS. Join the @APWUnational's movement to #SaveThePostOffice and attend a demonstration at your local post office tomorrow, August 25: https://t.co/MpFFBUcQhw
The police who shot Jacob Blake in the back seven times must be fired, arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Congress cannot wait any longer to act forcefully to end the horrific violence against Black Americans at the hands of police.
We cannot accept that our children and grandchildren must face worse fires, worse hurricanes, worse floods and more disasters every year. We must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and end their greed. We must pass a Green New Deal. https://t.co/BNIvc8SSh3
100 days.\n\nThat's how long ago the House passed a bill to extend $600 a week to 30 million unemployed workers, $1,200 for the working class, hazard pay and $25 billion for the Post Office.\n\nDuring this time, the Senate passed a $740 billion Pentagon budget and took a vacation.
If there's going to be a class war in this country, it's time the working class won that war. We can no longer tolerate 3 billionaires owning more wealth than the bottom 50%. We must tax the obscene gains billionaires made in the pandemic and create an economy that works for all.
California is on fire. Once in a lifetime hurricanes are sweeping the Gulf Coast. The Arctic topped 100 degrees. The future of our planet is at stake this election. We can no longer have a president in office who rejects science and calls climate change a hoax. #GreenNewDeal
Never forget. While the Republican Senate refused to extend $600/week for 30 million unemployed workers, it had no problem passing a $1 trillion tax break to the top 1% and large corporations. Trump and the Republicans love socialism for the rich, rugged capitalism for the rest.
How absurd. Now, Trump believes he's not only smarter than scientists, but that they are actively plotting against his re-election. We need a president who listens to scientists, not someone who concocts bizarre conspiracy theories. The \"very stable genius\" must be defeated. https://t.co/389bCXKxWa
While 92 million can't afford health care, the 4 richest Americans are now worth $512.8 billion:\n\n- Jeff Bezos: $193 billion\n- Bill Gates: $122 billion\n- Mark Zuckerberg: $101 billion\n- Elon Musk: $96.8 billion\n\nIt's time to tax the billionaire class and expand Medicare to all.
This November, we have got to come out and vote in record-breaking numbers.\n\nGet your mail-in ballots sent early.\n\nBring your friends and neighbors to the polls.\n\nOur job is to defeat Trump and remind him what democracy is. https://t.co/aWj92eGbPF
Over 1 million Americans filed for unemployment this week. Republicans in the Senate are doing nothing to provide relief. Join me now for a town hall with @MarkPocan to demand McConnell and Republican leadership take action. https://t.co/OE4i8RE1R7
While Californians suffer, the president, as usual, blames everyone else. Trump is a pathological liar and his rejection of science is a disaster. He must be defeated badly, and we must take bold action to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and save the planet. https://t.co/YZYobm7iA6
Too many people have fought and died for democracy. Donald Trump, we are not going to let you destroy that democracy. https://t.co/fQDcUQduHm

TODAY: Join our town halls on addressing the crises in Iowa and Wisconsin at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/ZVWUjfSkT9
Sen. Paul is dead wrong. The beauty of the Postal Service is that it doesn't matter if you're a low-income senior living on a dirt road in Kentucky or a wealthy CEO living on Park Avenue—you get your mail delivered 6 days a week at a low cost. We must save, not dismantle, USPS. https://t.co/DIGZBxjXm1
The American people are already paying for a vaccine through their tax dollars.\n\nWhen a vaccine does become available, every American must receive that vaccine for free. https://t.co/Q9oNDf8qQI
While 40 million Americans face eviction, Wall Street is making record profits.\n\nWhile 30 million workers lost jobs, 12 billionaires are now worth a record $1 trillion.\n\nNo. We don't need austerity for working families. We need austerity for the 1% and multinational corporations.
Join @nationalnurses for a webinar on the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on people of color in America, particularly Black Americans, and how we must work to ensure economic, social, and environmental equity for all: https://t.co/IVPMgBJ6V4
Millions rely on the Postal Service for prescription drugs that treat diabetes, high blood pressure and more.\n\nTrump's attack on the Postal Service doesn't just threaten our election, it could very well be deadly as well.\n\nPostmaster General DeJoy must go.\nhttps://t.co/zqKoGH8MZz
Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump plays golf at his country club and Senate Republicans take a vacation while 40 million Americans face eviction and 30 million workers are unemployed. It's time for the Senate to do its job, protect working families and get back to work now.
Medicare for All is not a radical idea, but let me tell you what is. A cruel system that causes 92 million Americans to be uninsured or under-insured during a pandemic, while the health care industry made $54.6 billion in profits during the last quarter alone. That's radical.
Every year we see more extreme weather disasters. Every year we see more people displaced, homes destroyed and lives lost due to climate change.\n\nWe cannot accept that this is our children's future. \n\nWe must end dependence on fossil fuels and pass a Green New Deal. https://t.co/JMOFUu4UWu
We have a president who has admitted that he is trying to destroy the Postal Service to prevent people from voting. This election is about whether we retain our democracy. https://t.co/8Zt3hs42EZ
Another 1.1 million Americans have filed for unemployment. \n\nPeople are going hungry and being evicted.\n\nIt's beyond comprehension that Mitch McConnell and the do-nothing Republican Senate refuse to take action.\n\nLeader McConnell: Get back to work and pass relief for Americans.
The day is coming—and must come—when in this country, health care is seen as a human right, not just a job benefit.
All of the mail sorting machines and blue mailboxes that have been removed must be replaced, overtime for postal workers must be restored, and the Postmaster General must be removed from office. Trump's attack on the Postal Service cannot stand. \nhttps://t.co/bbIHueytUC
When we talk about creating an economy and a government based on justice, it means racial justice and the end of systemic racism in this country in every aspect of our lives.
Working Americans are devastated by the pandemic and Republicans are doing nothing. Iowans are recovering from a disastrous derecho and Trump is doing nothing. Unacceptable.\n\nJoin our town halls on Saturday on addressing the crises in Iowa and Wisconsin at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS https://t.co/IHaUBsCmm3

This is the language used by demagogues. Trump is going to lose not because of non-existent voter fraud. He's going to lose because the American people are sick and tired of his pathological lies, his rejection of science, his racism and his sexism. https://t.co/CxoE9sKqzc
Today we recognize the incredible courage of the women who fought to pass the 19th Amendment 100 years ago. We must also recognize that the right to vote, particularly for women of color, is still at risk, and our struggle for justice continues. #WomensVote100

We must come together, defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president. My friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine. #DemConvention
I say to everyone who supported other candidates in the primary and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election: \n\nThe future of our democracy is at stake.\n\nThe future of our economy is at stake.\n\nThe future of our planet is at stake. #DemConvention
Together we must build a nation that is more equitable and more inclusive. I know that Joe Biden will begin that fight on day one. #DemConvention
Since this pandemic began, 30+ million people have lost their jobs and many have lost their health insurance. \n\nMillions are wondering how they'll feed their kids and worried that they will be evicted. \n\nTrump's negligence has exacerbated the economic crisis. #DemConvention
Trump isn't just a threat to our democracy, but by rejecting science he has put our lives in jeopardy.\n\nTrump has attacked doctors and scientists trying to protect us from the pandemic and refused to take strong action.\n\nNero fiddled while Rome burned; Trump golfs. #DemConvention
Under this administration, authoritarianism has taken root in our country. As long as I am here, I will work with progressives, with moderates, and, yes, with conservatives to preserve this nation from a threat that so many of our heroes fought and died to defeat. #DemConvention
Our campaign ended several months ago, but our movement continues. Many of the ideas we fought for, that just a few years ago were considered \"radical,\" are now mainstream. But if Trump is re-elected, all the progress we have made will be in jeopardy. #DemConvention
Together we have moved this country in a bold new direction showing that all of us — Black and white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, native born and immigrant — yearn for a nation based on the principles of justice, love, and compassion. #DemConvention
We need an unprecedented response to the crises we face—a movement, like never before, of people who are prepared to stand up and fight for democracy and decency—and against greed, oligarchy, and bigotry. And we need Joe Biden as our next president. #DemConvention
We face the most important election in the modern history of this country. We need a movement of people to stand up for democracy and decency. Join me live at the @DemConvention: https://t.co/qFIXSJeGpW
We have got to beat Trump, an authoritarian who is trying to undermine American democracy. But it is not good enough just to defeat Trump. We need to create a new America and a government and an economy that works for all and not just a few.
Mr. President. Admit it. Your executive order on housing is a total fraud. The 40 million Americans who face eviction don't need more studies. They need the Senate to cancel rent and ban evictions. Tell Senate Republicans to come back from vacation and pass legislation now. https://t.co/2CDDNa39oP
For once in his life Trump was actually honest.\n\nHe was honest when he said he's trying to destroy the Postal Service because he wants to suppress the vote.\n\nSorry, Mr. President. Too many people fought and died for American democracy. You're not going to destroy it. https://t.co/wGYhybCtVd
It's absolutely unacceptable that 467 billionaires increased their wealth by $731 billion during the pandemic, while 30 million Americans lost their jobs and now face hunger and eviction. Now, more than ever, we need an economy that works for all, not the 1%. The Senate must act.
What's happening in Iowa is absolutely unacceptable. While Trump plays golf, tens of thousands of Iowans don't have electricity or running water in the middle of a pandemic. This storm hit almost a week ago. Do your job and declare a federal disaster, President Trump.
This is a time of great national crisis and Mitch McConnell has got to understand the realities facing working people right now. https://t.co/QhV4NYGWJ2
Let's be clear. Trump is working overtime to slow down the mail —including people's medicine, paychecks and bill payments—in order to keep people from voting in a pandemic. We will not let him succeed. We will sweep him out of office and defend the Postal Service.
The Postmaster General must resign immediately.

When we talk about achieving justice for workers in America, that means fighting to end the disgrace of Black women making only 62 cents on the dollar compared to white men. #BlackWomensEqualPayDay
Do not forget. The attacks on the Postal Service did not begin with Trump. Republicans have been trying to privatize it for years. We cannot allow them to destroy it—Congress must expand and strengthen the Postal Service and protect 630,000 jobs.
Today on Fox, Trump made it clear that his effort to defund the Postal Service is a blatant attempt at mass voter suppression. No, Mr. President. We won't let you sabotage the election. This is a democracy, not a damn dictatorship. Your reign of authoritarianism will soon end. https://t.co/CI24RvFtFm
Trump just repeated that if he's re-elected he'll \"terminate\" the funding for Social Security. Well, I've got some bad news for Trump and his billionaire friends on Wall Street.

Millions of people are losing their health insurance during a pandemic and a housing crisis. No. We cannot maintain a system that treats health care an employee benefit. It must be a right. We need Medicare for All.
Shock of shocks. The same Republicans who tell us we can't afford to provide $600 a week in unemployment benefits to 30 million Americans want to give a $102 billion tax break for the wealthy. Yes.

Mr. President: 11 days ago 30 million Americans lost $600/week in benefits. They're living in desperation and fear. The only way they can get help now is if you negotiate with Congress and sign legislation into law. Phony and unconstitutional executive orders won't pay the bills.
Huge corporations like Uber will do anything to avoid paying workers a decent wage with good benefits, but their greed cannot and will not stand. This is a major victory. We must keep fighting until all workers live in dignity. https://t.co/1Kqy0Rn1C1

The $600 a week in additional unemployment insurance has helped many Americans stay afloat during this terrible pandemic. If you received it, how does that assistance being cut or reduced affect you and your family?
This pandemic has exposed the ugly realities of the rigged economy. While 467 billionaires saw their wealth increase by $730 billion in the last few months, working families lost their jobs, health care and homes. We need an economy that works for all, not just the 1%.
Congratulations to @BethDoglio on advancing to the general election. She will fight for a Green New Deal and health care for all. Let's do everything we can to put her in Congress. https://t.co/9Z2Zm3ZRnh
President Trump: stop being a phony. Your executive order on housing is a cruel joke. Your \"eviction moratorium\" won't prevent one tenant from being evicted or provide one cent to pay the rent. 40 million Americans are in danger of being evicted. Stop lying. Cancel the rent now.
Trump &amp; Senate Republicans have made it clear what their agenda is:\n\n- Defund Social Security &amp; Medicare\n- Defund unemployment benefits\n- Dismantle the Postal Service\n- More tax breaks for the 1%\n- More corporate welfare for defense contractors\n\nThey must be defeated - big time.
Today, Trump announced that if he is re-elected he will permanently defund Social Security. That may make sense to the billionaires at his country club, but it makes zero sense to me. \n\nNo, Mr. President. We will not let you destroy Social Security. We will defeat you – badly.
President Trump. Stop being a total fraud and support the $600 a week unemployment supplement passed by the House 2 months ago. \n\nHow can states come up with 25% of the cost when many of them are already on the verge of bankruptcy? What a scam. https://t.co/KYMe65wAVz
Trump may not know it while playing golf with his billionaire friends, but millions of unemployed Americans are now going hungry and facing evictions. If the GOP can provide $1 trillion in tax breaks for the rich, they can support a $600 supplement for unemployment insurance.

At a time when so many are hurting, the very, very, very rich should not be getting much richer. By taxing the wealth gains made by just a few hundred billionaires during this pandemic, we can provide health care for all. https://t.co/QTUhEovZ83
There's a reason why Trump wants to sabotage the U.S. Postal Service. In a pandemic, people need mail-in ballots.\n\nIf the mail is delayed, as Trump is doing, fewer people will vote.

Wealth gains by billionaires during the pandemic:\n\nJeff Bezos: +$71 billion\nWalton Family: +$21 billion\nMark Zuckerberg: +$38 billion\n\nBy taxing 60% of the wealth gains by 467 billionaires, we could cover all out-of-pocket health care costs for a year.

It is time for the Senate to act on behalf of the working class who are hurting like they have never hurt before, not the billionaire class who are doing phenomenally well and have never had it so good.
We have a choice to make. We can continue to allow the very rich to get much richer while everyone else gets poorer and poorer. Or we can tax the winnings a handful of billionaires made during the pandemic to improve the health and well-being of tens of millions of Americans.
In my view, we can no longer tolerate the three wealthiest people in America owning more wealth than the bottom 50 percent, while over 30 million Americans have lost their jobs and 92 million people are either uninsured or under-insured.
Yes, by taxing 60% of the wealth gains made by just 467 billionaires during this pandemic, we could guarantee health care as a right for an entire year. And billionaires would still be able to pocket over $310 billion in gains during the worst downturn since the Great Depression.
If we taxed 60% of the windfall gains 467 billionaires made from March 18th until August 3rd we could raise over $420 billion. That's enough revenue to allow Medicare to pay all of the out-of-pocket health care expenses for everyone in America over the next 12 months.
At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when so many our people are hurting, it is morally obscene for billionaires to use a global pandemic as an opportunity to make outrageous profits.
While millions of Americans are lining up at emergency food banks because they don't have enough money to put food on the table, Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook has increased his wealth by more than $37 billion during the pandemic and is now worth over $90 billion.
While 40 million Americans face eviction, Elon Musk has nearly tripled his wealth over the past four months and now has a net worth of more than $70 billion.
While U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing the starvation wages at Walmart, our nation's largest private employer, the Walton family has made over $20 billion during the pandemic and now has a net worth of over $200 billion.
While Amazon is denying paid sick leave, hazard pay and personal protective equipment to 450,000 of its workers, Jeff Bezos has increased his wealth by over $70 billion.
Let me give you a few examples of the incredible growth in inequality that is taking place during this horrific pandemic.
In the midst of a president undermining democracy and moving us toward an authoritarian government, in the midst of all of that, we are seeing a massive increase in income and wealth inequality and the movement in this country toward oligarchy.
In other words, in the midst of a pandemic, in the midst of an economic meltdown for working families, in the midst of a great struggle regarding systemic racism and police brutality, in the midst of the existential threat of climate change...
In all likelihood, in the midst of everything else, we are currently witnessing what is likely the greatest transfer of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the very rich in the modern history of this country.
Meanwhile, during the last four months, while the very, very rich have become much richer, American households have seen their wealth go down by $6.5 trillion.
Let me repeat that. 467 billionaires have seen their wealth go up by over $730 billion during the pandemic.
While over 30 million Americans have seen their $600 a week in unemployment benefits expire, emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve to prop up the stock market have meant that 467 billionaires saw their wealth go up by over $730 billion since the pandemic began.
What I think many people do not fully understand is that not everyone is hurting in America.  Not everyone needs the Senate to act.
I will be introducing legislation tomorrow to tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires have made during the public health crisis.

All across this country, from coast to coast, people are standing up and fighting back — not only against Trump, but for an agenda that works for the working families of this country.
Progressives are on the move. Reps. @RashidaTlaib and @PramilaJayapal last night won landslide re-election victories, and @CoriBush scored an incredible upset win in Missouri. So what do these victories say about the current moment?

10. Donald Trump is hostile to the LGBTQ community.
9. Donald Trump is a religious bigot.
8. Donald Trump is a sexist.
7. Donald Trump is a xenophobe.
6. Donald Trump is a racist.
5. Donald Trump's policies benefit his billionaire friends, while attacking the needs of working families.
4. Donald Trump does not believe in science.
3. Donald Trump is a pathological liar.
2. Donald Trump does not understand or respect the Constitution of the United States.
1. Donald Trump is, at his core, an authoritarian leader who does not believe in democracy.
I want to give you ten reasons (and there are many more) as to why, together, we have got to do everything we can to create the largest voter turnout in history and send Trump packing.
This is a no-brainer. Masks are not a political or partisan issue. Providing all of our people with high-quality, reusable masks without cost will save tens of thousands of lives and save our economy billions of dollars. https://t.co/iihyD3m6Pb

And the very rich get much richer. Over half of American households have lost income during the pandemic, while 491 billionaires have increased their wealth by $743 billion. This is obscene. We need an economy that works for all, not a rigged economy for the wealthy and powerful.
The clock is ticking. While the economy tanks, some 30 million workers are losing their $600 a week unemployment supplement. Their families are facing hunger, eviction and foreclosure. The House has acted. The Senate must act NOW.
The U.S. economy shrank a record-breaking 33% in the second quarter. How many more Americans have to lose their jobs, health insurance and housing before the do-nothing Senate acts to protect the working class?\n\nExtend unemployment, pass $2,000 monthly payments &amp; cancel rent now.
The House passed legislation to extend the expanded unemployment program on May 15.\n\nThat was 78 days ago.\n\nBut Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans refused to act. Now, 30 million Americans are scrambling to make ends meet. The Republicans must get their act together.
Sad but not surprising. The Senate GOP chose to let $600 a week in unemployment benefits expire for 30 million Americans, but had no problem giving the Pentagon another $740 billion. We need new national priorities. Let's stand with workers, not the Military Industrial Complex.
Eid Mubarak to all of our Muslim friends. May today bring peace, safety and happiness to you and your loved ones.

In the U.S.A., 3 multi-billionaires own more wealth than the bottom half of the country.  Meanwhile, we're the only major nation not to guarantee health care, paid family and medical leave or vacation time. We need a government that represents all of us, not just the few.
Senate Republicans will propose a bill to slash unemployment benefits, increase the Pentagon budget and provide another tax break to CEOs. Unacceptable. We need a COVID-19 relief bill that works for the working class and the most vulnerable, not wealthy campaign contributors.

Today I'm proud to endorse @joekimok for Broward County State Attorney. Joe has witnessed first-hand the devastation our criminal legal system causes. The people of Broward County have a huge opportunity to bring real change to their communities by electing him. https://t.co/2YY4a1h2mZ
The fact that Jeff Bezos increased his wealth by $13 billion in 1 day during a pandemic, while his employees struggle to make ends meet and 50 million Americans are filing for unemployment, tells you a great deal about how our economy is rigged in favor of the billionaire class.
One of the most important things you can do right now is to make sure progressives win primaries at all levels of government. Sign up for our day of action tomorrow to support candidates like @BethDoglio, @PramilaJayapal and @CoriBush: https://t.co/2PVjAIB7Ca
Trump wants to give wealthy businessmen a tax break to go out to fancy restaurants, but opposes nutrition assistance to millions of low-income Americans who are going hungry. Yes. Trump loves corporate socialism for his rich friends, unfettered capitalism for everyone else.
If we stand together, we can pass a Green New Deal and protect the planet for future generations. Join our organizing call with @sunrisemvmt and @CoriBush live now: https://t.co/oA6YOAAvet
Join our day of action on Saturday! Let's continue the political revolution and expand our movement by electing strong candidates across the country. https://t.co/jHVF8KavyW
Today, almost half of the Senate Democratic Caucus voted to cut Pentagon spending by 10% and invest in human needs. We'll continue building a movement which understands the importance of investing in working people, not spending more on defense than the next 11 nations combined.
TONIGHT: Join me, @sunrisemvmt, and @CoriBush for an important organizing call. \n\nTogether, we can win a progressive agenda and a Green New Deal.\n\nRSVP at https://t.co/cYus6ur84q. https://t.co/6Cn69MJynF
22 million people are in danger of eviction.\n\n50 million have filed for unemployment.\n\nThis is not the time to spend more than the next 11 nations combined on the military.\n\nTell your senator to support my amendment to cut the military budget by 10% by calling 202-224-3121.
Rep. Ted Yoho should spend his time fighting for the thousands of Floridians who are about to lose unemployment benefits and face evictions, not denigrate and insult a champion of working families like @AOC. We need more AOC and less Yoho in Congress.
Tomorrow night, join me, @sunrisemvmt, and congressional candidate @CoriBush for an important call on continuing our movement to advance a progressive agenda and a Green New Deal. RSVP at https://t.co/Qfsdfb9IvM. https://t.co/08PXEoCxJY
Trump has now concluded that wearing masks is a good idea. That's great. Tragically, for thousands who unnecessarily died, it's three months too late. We need a government that believes in science, not one undermining the CDC. For the health of our nation, Trump must go.
We must change our priorities. Add your name to say you support a 10% cut in annual Pentagon spending to allow for investments in jobs, education, health care and poverty reduction in America's most vulnerable communities. https://t.co/SeIu7WM5Ml
What if maybe, just maybe, instead of passing a $740 billion defense budget, the Senate used funds to create jobs and build:\n\n-Affordable housing\n-Schools\n-Childcare facilities\n-Community health centers\n-Public hospitals\n-Libraries\n-Clean water facilities
My Senate colleagues have a fundamental choice:\n\nVote to spend more money on endless wars while failing to provide economic security to millions of Americans.\n\nOr vote to spend less on weapons and cost overruns, and more to rebuild struggling communities in their home states.
During this pandemic Jeff Bezos saw his wealth increase by $74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, 50 million Americans are filing for unemployment, and millions face hunger, lack of health care and evictions.\n\nUnacceptable!\n\nWe must create an economy that works for all, not just the very rich.
As coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths are surging to record levels across America, the Republican Senate has decided to provide more funding for the Pentagon than the next 11 nations' military budgets combined. Simply outrageous.
"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed." -President Eisenhower\n\nWe must cut the Pentagon budget by 10%. https://t.co/s4wsLMKM0P
Today I stand with workers across the country who are participating in the #StrikeForBlackLives. Our job as a nation: eradicate all forms of racial injustice in every part of our society so that Black Americans can finally live in security and dignity.
We have got to transform our priorities. We should not pass a $740 billion defense budget at a time when so many are struggling. https://t.co/hvzRLkztIr
Tens of millions of Americans have filed for unemployment and this is what the Republicans are offering? Instead, we should extend unemployment benefits, provide $2,000 a month to every American, and expand Medicare to all.\nhttps://t.co/WrjPK2Zpg1
In recent months 30 million workers have lost their jobs and their income. Many struggle to put food on the table. This week the Senate must pass a bill to fully extend unemployment benefits, provide a $2,000 monthly stipend and guarantee health care for the length of the crisis.
In the richest nation in the world, people are forced to risk their lives for starvation wages. That is a moral outrage. Every worker deserves a living wage and a safe workplace, especially in the middle of a deadly pandemic. https://t.co/Vf6c4Enclo
The U.S.A. is the only major country not to guarantee health care to all. If you're wealthy you can buy excellent care. If you're poor or working class, tough luck. You die younger and experience more illness and pain. Health care is a human right. We need Medicare for All.
Amidst the many crises we face, we cannot ignore that the climate crisis is getting worse. Now is the time to end our dependence on fossil fuels and move to renewable energy. Now is the time for a Green New Deal. https://t.co/MBQ1S6vdKY
Against the wishes of state and local officials, unmarked federal agents in combat gear have invaded parts of Portland, Oregon. This is what a police state looks like.  These troops must be withdrawn immediately. We must defend the Constitution. We must defeat Trump.
Let's use the Defense Production Act and get every American the masks they need. https://t.co/lj9jErLNqY
John Lewis inspired millions to fight for justice. His courage helped transform this country. He won't ever be forgotten by those who believe America can change when the people stand together and demand it. Our thoughts are with his loved ones.
In Portland, federal agents in combat gear pulled protesters off the street and jailed them without charge. That is what a police state is all about. Now is the time to defend our Constitution. Now is the time to come together and defeat Trump's authoritarian policies. https://t.co/fZn1hrk4YE
We must reduce the military budget by 10% and use that $74 billion in savings to invest in communities ravaged by extreme poverty, mass incarceration, decades of neglect and the COVID-19 pandemic. https://t.co/Ud15Y9BOGG
In 2018, Floridians overwhelmingly voted to re-enfranchise felons. The outrageous poll tax passed in response to that referendum is racist voter suppression at its worst. Voting is a right, not a privilege. These attacks on Americans' constitutional rights have got to end. https://t.co/oWgbz4NCLg
It's time to rethink what we value as a society and to fundamentally transform our national priorities. \n\nCutting the military budget by 10% and investing that money in human needs is a modest way to begin that process.\n\nLet's get it done.\nhttps://t.co/J5GY8NfASn
Congratulations to @JamaalBowmanNY for winning the congressional primary in NY-16! Jamaal will be a powerful advocate for a progressive agenda and I look forward to working with him in Congress. https://t.co/806TWp1LPL
I stand with the workers and immigrants in New York fighting for a just coronavirus relief package and to #FundExcludedWorkers. We cannot get through this pandemic without protecting the most vulnerable among us. https://t.co/18khYNk1wu
Because of Trump's ineptitude the pandemic is getting worse. He must be defeated. https://t.co/XgIGtRrnKl
While 29 new people in America became billionaires, 119 million Americans have seen their income go down.
While Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, Gilead is charging more than $3,000 for a COVID-19 drug that costs $10 to manufacture and was developed after receiving a $70 million grant from the federal government.
While Amazon refuses to provide paid sick leave to its workers and recently eliminated hazard pay for essential workers, the owner of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, has seen his wealth go up by $74 billion making him the wealthiest person in America with a net worth of $179 billion.
While American households have lost $6.5 trillion in wealth and 50 million Americans have filed for unemployment, the wealth of 600 billionaires in America has gone up by $584 billion.
While one out of five Americans cannot afford the medicine prescribed by their doctors, the CEO of Moderna became a billionaire overnight after his company received $483 million from the Trump administration to develop a potential coronavirus vaccine.
While 28 million Americans are in danger of being evicted from their homes and thrown out on the street, JP Morgan Chase posted a record-breaking $33.8 billion in quarterly revenue.
During the pandemic, while a record-breaking 5.4 million Americans lost their health insurance, UnitedHealth—one of the largest health insurance companies in America—made a record-breaking quarterly profit of $6.6 billion.
Pharmaceutical companies have been given $6 billion in taxpayer dollars, and more to come, to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Once a safe and effective vaccine is approved by the FDA it must be made available to all for free. This is no time for profiteering.
Don't let anybody fool you. The progressive movement today is winning. https://t.co/3paAZKwuRf
Due to technical difficulties we are postponing tonight's livestream. Thank you to all our panelists and to those who tuned in.
STARTING SOON: Join our virtual town hall on the growing danger of the coronavirus pandemic, featuring @FlyingWithSara, @TwuSamuelsen, @AbdulElSayed, and @RishiDesaiMD. Tune in at 8 p.m. ET on Twitter or at https://t.co/vreIiWwPgq. https://t.co/lS4Is8mX0c
Tragically, Trump's rejection of science has led to the loss of tens of thousands of lives.\n\nPer capita, in the U.S. COVID-19 has caused:\n\n94 times more deaths than Australia\n74 times more deaths than South Korea\n53 times more deaths than Japan\n2.8 times more deaths than Germany
.@IlhanMN is a woman of incredible strength. We need her leadership in Congress. I'm pleased to endorse her campaign for reelection. https://t.co/qtCscIyOLJ
Congratulations @SiegelForTexas for winning his primary for TX-10! We need progressives like Mike to be elected to Congress so we can continue to build a country that works for all, not just the 1%. https://t.co/hxqcQD6LEZ
Congratulations to @JosePGarza for winning the primary runoff to be Travis County's next district attorney. We need progressive leaders everywhere who will reform our broken and racist criminal justice system, and I look forward to seeing José bring change in Texas. https://t.co/gkSI7UsV9a
When people come together to stand up for justice, we win. \n\nCongratulations to the young people and community organizers who fought for this victory. \n\nTogether, we'll end our dependence on fossil fuels and ensure a livable planet for Vermonters and all future generations. https://t.co/3CqcWQo9t1
Millions of Americans lost jobs during the pandemic. Meanwhile, JP Morgan Chase—the largest bank in the country—announced its biggest quarterly revenue in history. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality we need an economy that works for workers, not just billionaires.
Here's the state of our economy.\n\nOver the last 30 years, the top 1% has seen an increase in  wealth of $22 trillion, while the bottom 50% has actually seen a decline in wealth.\n\nWe must fight for an economy that works for all, not just the few.
Texas: vote today for @JosePGarza and @SiegelForTexas! Be safe and find your voting information at https://t.co/W4dsTuvoJM. https://t.co/taguxy7pwQ
.@KatrinaNation is absolutely right. We must change our priorities and invest in the needs of working Americans, not spend billions on our bloated defense budget. https://t.co/QCXMaZB7rr
The change we need will not happen tomorrow. But it is important that we maintain our vision and continue to fight. https://t.co/RXOIZUJpx9
The fact that our \"very stable genius\" president prefers to be briefed about the pandemic by a game show host on Twitter instead of scientists and doctors tells you everything you need to know about how clueless and pathetic the Trump administration is. Trump must be defeated. https://t.co/wruxHuAI8A
As the pandemic surges, Trump is more clueless, isolated and unhinged than ever. He is undermining Dr. Fauci, and believes that \"everyone is lying\" about COVID-19, including the CDC. For the sake of science and the health of our nation, Trump must be defeated.
Texas, vote for @SiegelForTexas tomorrow to help us continue our fight for Medicare for All, a livable planet and to get big money out of politics. https://t.co/v8mlLWewpz
Trump is finally wearing a mask. Too little too late. \n\nHis refusal to develop national pandemic policy based on science has led to widespread confusion and cost us many thousands of lives. \n\nTrump has rejected science. In November, we must come together and reject Trump.
Trump commutes Roger Stone's sentence, while Black and Brown kids sit in jail. This is why we need major reform of a broken and racist criminal justice system. No more two-tier justice. Rich or poor, Black, white or Latino — we need \"equal justice under law.\"
Mitt Romney and I hold different opinions on virtually everything. But I agree with him strongly that Trump's commutation of Roger Stone's sentence is \"unprecedented, historic corruption.\" The key political question of our time is: Where are all the other Republicans?
It's summer. It's hot. It's vacation time. Sadly, the U.S. is the only major country not to guarantee any paid vacation or holidays. The result: 1 in 4 workers get no paid vacation time or holidays. This is outrageous. We need an economy that works for workers, not just owners.
We can keep winning races and electing progressives around the country, but we need your help. Join our #SummerOfAction and sign up to make calls today! https://t.co/VUUxxLRXi2
This month the Senate will vote on my amendment to cut the Pentagon's bloated $740 billion budget and invest in housing, health care, education and jobs in distressed communities here at home. I thank @chuckschumer for his support for this amendment and securing a vote on it. https://t.co/fhkWtmvr6f
Trump rejects science on COVID-19. And thousands unnecessarily die. \n\nTrump rejects science on climate change. And the very future of the planet is at stake.\n\nWe cannot continue a government which rejects science.\n\nThis November, we must come together and reject Trump.
Here's something we don't discuss much. Life expectancy is in direct correlation to income. If you're rich you're likely to live a much longer and healthier life than if you're poor. Poverty kills. Our job: build a health care system and economy that work for all, not just a few.
Sign up to join our day of action on Saturday! Let's continue the political revolution and expand our movement by electing strong progressive candidates across the country.\nhttps://t.co/YGTHHt0B4z
Our job: put as much pressure as possible on Republican leaders to take action to help the American people right now. https://t.co/SbX3CIEY6x
Jane and I are deeply saddened to hear that Pamela Sue Rush has passed away. I will always carry with me what she showed us. She was a mother, an activist and an unyielding spirit. She will be deeply missed. But, as I promised, I will make sure her story is never forgotten. https://t.co/E5eMz7dnHw
As someone who grew up in poverty, @JulieOliverTX knows the struggle working Texans face each and every day. The people of Texas' 25th Congressional District need Julie fighting for them in Congress, and I'm proud to support her grassroots campaign. https://t.co/Ggo0mA0PDx
.@paulajean2020 will be a senator who stands up to the political and economic establishment, puts the working class first, and fights to guarantee health care as a human right. I'm proud to endorse her grassroots campaign and I hope the people of West Virginia will support her. https://t.co/jlZM7FrSGO
I don't have to tell anybody that these are really crazy times. \n\nBut we cannot lose sight of the fact that we have a global climate crisis. \n\nAnd we cannot allow Congress to pass an outrageous $740 billion defense budget while neglecting the needs of our people. https://t.co/YVwwYC3UEM
I look forward to working with Vice President Biden to help him win this campaign and to move this country forward toward economic, racial, social, and environmental justice. 3/3
Though the end result isn't what I or my supporters would've written alone, the task forces have created a good policy blueprint that will move this country in a much-needed progressive direction and substantially improve the lives of working families throughout our country. 2/3
While @JoeBiden and I, and our supporters, have strong disagreements about some of the most important issues facing our country, we also understand that we must come together in order to defeat Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history. 1/3 https://t.co/0sO3oGkBmr
Let's keep up the momentum for progressive candidates running across the country! Sign up to join our Summer of Action and make calls for @RashidaTlaib, @CoriBush, @PramilaJayapal and more this Saturday:\nhttps://t.co/sprbuvhy3g
Should decisions on health care be determined by the patient? Or, should they be controlled by the whims of the employer? Today's Supreme Court decision makes it clear why health care is a human right, not an employee benefit, and why we must pass Medicare for All.
Patients' ability to get contraception shouldn't be up to employers. It should be a decision between patients and their doctors. \n\nHealth care—including birth control—is a right, not an employee benefit.\n\nWe must fight Trump's rollback of these rights by passing Medicare for All. https://t.co/xYIthLjUTU
Congratulations to @Bonnie4Congress for winning her primary last night. I look forward to continue working with her in Congress to fight for working people across New Jersey and the entire country. https://t.co/UKo7W5k0vg
This economic crisis is not ending soon.\n\nTens of millions of people have lost their jobs.\n\nThey should not lose their housing too.\n\nThere must be an immediate, nationwide moratorium on evictions, foreclosures, and utility shut-offs.
It's always unacceptable for the U.S. to have more people in jail than any country on Earth, but especially so during a pandemic. During this crisis we must keep people out of jail who shouldn't be there and continue our fight to end mass incarceration. https://t.co/N4aJGoFto8
Trump may not understand it, but high-quality masks, distributed to every American household and produced in the U.S. through the Defense Production Act, will save many thousands of lives. I am fighting for that amendment in the Defense Authorization Act.
New Jersey: remember to vote today and cast your ballot for @Bonnie4Congress and @Arati4Congress. Let's send these strong progressives to the U.S. House. Find the voting information you need here: https://t.co/2yHkKQSPN0 https://t.co/kKdOqqjua1
Trump's pathological lying never stops. While he continues to tell us how great the \"recovery\" is doing, the pandemic surges and millions face hunger, eviction and loss of health care. Together, we'll defeat Trump. Together, we'll move this country in a very different direction.
The temperature in Siberia is 100 degrees, wildfires are raging there and sea ice is melting. In the midst of all the other crises we face, we cannot forget climate change. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Now!
Congratulations to the many Native Americans and advocates who struggled to defeat this terrible pipeline, which should never have been built. We must end our dependence on fossil fuels and stop putting corporate profits over Native American rights. The struggle continues. https://t.co/p03f3IEU4g
Politicians and the corporate media won't discuss it much but over the past 30 years the wealth of the top 1% has gone up by $22.65 trillion, while the wealth of the bottom 50% has gone down by $776 billion. This growing wealth inequality is a moral obscenity.
We need to stop bipartisan support for a bloated military budget. While defense contractors make huge profits and we spend more on the military than the next 11 nations combined, doctors and nurses lack masks to help us fight COVID-19. Insane priorities.
We spend $740 billion on the Pentagon, but somehow we don't have enough money to provide health care, housing and childcare to all Americans. My amendment to cut the defense budget by 10% would begin to change our priorities. It will be voted on in the Senate the week of July 20.
"We need elected leaders who are going to stand for what is morally right. Who are going to stand up for humanity. That, at the end of the day, is what people in the community respond to." –@Arati4Congress https://t.co/4W40lWxzal
Today I want to wish everybody a happy Fourth of July weekend. I hope that today, we take a look at where we have come from as a nation, the good and the bad, and where we want to go together in the future. https://t.co/kWzhUhp5KX
She wants to create millions of good-paying jobs and rebuild our infrastructure and energy systems. She has been one of Trump's strongest opponents in Congress. Her voice is important as we push forward with the important work of making a more fair and just America for everyone.
I'm proud to endorse @Bonnie4Congress for re-election. Bonnie has always been a strong, progressive voice in the fight for the needs of working families. She understands health care is a human right and the importance of a Medicare for All, single-payer program to cover everyone. https://t.co/mOZYs2XZCN
The business model of the pharmaceutical industry is unfettered greed.\n\nThis is not the time for corporate profiteering of off death and suffering.\n\nWe must guarantee that coronavirus treatments and vaccines are free to all Americans. https://t.co/uibVEcHRwC
We need to reduce the military budget by 10% and use the savings to invest in distressed communities around the country that are experiencing extreme poverty, mass incarceration, deindustrialization and decades of neglect. https://t.co/l6WUABq6Hd
We need progressive leaders like @Booker4KY running for office, all over the country, at every level of government. That is how we carry on our movement to build a nation that is based on justice. https://t.co/PbdOsIh1Az
Rent is due for millions today, at a time when more than 45 million Americans have filed for unemployment.\n\nWe need to suspend rent and mortgage payments nationwide.\n\nWe also must extend the $600/week expansion of unemployment benefits, which expires at the end of the month.
In my view, the time is long overdue for us to take a hard look not only at the size of the Pentagon budget, but at the enormous amount of waste, cost overruns, fraud, and at the financial mismanagement that has plagued the Department of Defense for decades.
Congratulations to Colorado district attorney candidates @alonzopayneCO and @ap4ag for winning their primaries last night. Together, we can fundamentally reform our broken criminal justice system by electing progressives at every level. https://t.co/GML7Sr3WLf
