When politicians use faith as an excuse to pass and uphold laws that seize control of people's bodies but not guarantee them healthcare, feed the poor, shelter the homeless, or welcome the stranger, you have to wonder if it's really about faith at all.
Sick and tired of Republicans who co-opt faith as an excuse to advance bigotry and barbarism.\n\nFact is, if today Christ himself came to the floor of Congress and repeated his teachings, many would malign him as a radical and eject him from the chamber. https://t.co/y19PBDw5co
Maybe we should be. https://t.co/AC5491EW56
Genuine question for the media / law enforcement: why are you calling these armed neo-nazi groups breaking the law "militias" instead of "gangs" or "domestic terrorist groups?"
Journalists:"How do you feel about the Green New Deal" is not a climate change question.\n\nTry: "What is your plan to bring down emissions?" so voters actually understand if a candidate even *has* a plan for the worst impending crisis of our time, and can share what it is.
I still can't get over how bad the climate change section of the debate was last night.\n\nThis is the consequence of no climate questions in debates for years.\n\nThe questions were childish, no follow-up questions for basic information, &amp; there was almost no talk of solutions.
Just to be clear: there is nothing "pro-life" about denying people comprehensive sexual education, making birth control harder to access, forcing others to give birth against their will, and stripping them of healthcare and food assistance afterwards.
So what IS the Green New Deal, anyway? https://t.co/hqjMSpgxDg
For the record @Mike_Pence, it's Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez to you.
Pence demanding that Harris answer *his* own personal questions when he won't even answer the moderator's is gross, and exemplary of the gender dynamics so many women have to deal with at work.
Why is it that Mike Pence doesn't seem to have to answer any of the questions asked of him in this debate?
The Green New Deal is and has been lied about nonstop, and yet is STILL popular.\n\nIt's a massive job-creation and infrastructure plan to decarbonize &amp; increase quality of work and life.\n\nIt's okay to call the GOP out on those lies just as we call them out on all their other lies.
Fracking is bad, actually

There's no questionnaire about symptoms, no requirement to report to the House physician if we are experiencing symptoms, no temperature check upon arrival to DC, nothing.\n\nThen we all get on planes and travel back to our communities, often twice a week. It's dangerous.
400-500+ members of Congress regularly travel from every corner of the country to DC &amp; back.\n\nEach time we convene carries with it the potential of a superspreader event.\n\nIt's absolutely unacceptable that there is no regular temp-taking, testing, or contact tracing protocol. https://t.co/kMdujmNGmJ

Congressional GOP have made one thing extremely clear:\nTo them, there are no rules.\nThere are no principles.\nThere is only power.\n\nThey are ruthless, and always have been in my lifetime.\n\nDems must recognize they cannot be reasoned with at present &amp; better adapt to that reality. https://t.co/DPq6xj61fF

Our first, no 1 priority is to do everything possible to secure electoral college victory in Nov. \n\nThis is the fight of and for our lives. That has always been true, &amp; it becomes more true each day.\n\nOpponents of democracy need your resignation to succeed. Don't give it to them.
Now is not the time for cynicism or hopelessness. There is and continues to be political possibility to preserve our democracy &amp; move forward.\n\nIt will require each &amp; every one of us, from the streets to the Senate, to grow in courage, strength, and strategy. But it is possible.
We have lost a giant in the history of our nation with the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nIt is heartbreaking that in her final moments she was, as are many others, preoccupied with what would happen after her passing.\n\nI want to make one thing clear: we can, and must, fight. https://t.co/QEDDFtSwmK
Believe me, I too wish that a little carbon tax here &amp;a little fuel efficiency there would solve this.\n\nThere was a time in the early 90s where those policies could've made an enormous difference. But our leadership failed &amp; ran out the clock. Now we need WWII-level mobilization.
It's almost as if the climate crisis was punted for so long due to fossil fuel lobbyists &amp; weak political leadership that it‚Äòs exploded to become so large + lethal that we now need a massive infrastructure &amp; jobs plan to decarbonize the economy on a rapid timeline\n\n#GreenNewDeal https://t.co/Nda7IHdobw

It's astounding that after a massive family separation operation, mass sexual assault of detainees, trapping immigrants in COVID-infected detention centers, and now reports of mass hysterectomies (which the US has done before), abolishing ICE is controversial.\n\nWhere's the line?
The fact of the matter is the United States has engaged in a program of mass human rights violations targeting immigrants.\n\nThis includes mass child separation, systemic sexual assault of people in detention, kangaroo-court procedures, &amp; more.\n\nOur country must atone for it all. https://t.co/KaacDaww5t

It's not a coincidence that the GOP advanced tropes about non-citizenship to President Obama, Reps. Tlaib, Omar &amp; Pressley, &amp; now Sen. Kamala Harris; especially in moments of power.\n\nImplying poc "don't belong" in our country is one way of protecting a white supremacist vision.
Whether it's "where's the birth certificate?" to "send her back!" to "where were her parents from?"- these contrived claims (which are almost never levied at white US officials born abroad) catch on bc the supremacist idea that poc are inherently less legitimate has deep roots.
White supremacy is a belief system based on the idea that ppl of color, esp Black ppl, are fundamentally illegitimate as equal citizens or human beings.\n\nCalling into question the citizenship of elected officials of color, esp when the answer is obvious, is one way it manifests.
It's not just Trump that‚Äòs destroying the US Post Office.\n\nIt's the entire Republican Party.\n\nSenate &amp; House GOP could easily override a Trump veto of postal funding and help oversight.\n\nRepublicans are working with Trump to destroy the USPS and sabotage the delivery of ballots. https://t.co/5qIMUDxQot

We have 100+ statues and portraits in the Capitol. Almost all of them are of white men.\n\nEvery single statue there could be of a canonized saint and that *still* doesn't change the fact that the erasure of women &amp; BIPOC from American history is a feature of white supremacy.
Yep.\n\nAt no point did I say Fr.

When our legislative bodies aren't sufficiently responsive to tech, then that means we don't have the tools required to protect people.\n\nThis is partially why companies know way more about you than you may even be aware of - bc it's legal, and Congress is struggling to keep up.
Some context for a few folks getting upset at this: Congress is voting on legislation regarding Twitch today.\n\nIt's totally fine if you don't know what Twitch is. But tech literacy is becoming an growing need in Congress so we can legislate to protect people's privacy, etc.

He didn't even say my name.
The irony about Yoho's excuse for his "passion" in accosting me is that he says he has a personal history w/ poverty, and took offense that I discussed poverty and crime.\n\nSo... he accosted me... to prove poverty doesn't result in traumatized behavior?\n\nOK üëçüèΩ where's the apology https://t.co/BKzJa7KUBW
- Does not apologize or name any action he did\n- Does not accept responsibility\n- Lies (this was not a "conversation," it was verbal assault)\n- Distracts by making it abt poverty (ironically)\n- Says everyone else is wrong and the incident never happened.\n\nThis is not an apology.
Republican responds to calling a colleague "disgusting" &amp; a "f‚Äîing b*tch" w/ "I cannot apologize for my passion" and blaming others.\n\nI will not teach my nieces and young people watching that this an apology, and what they should learn to accept.\n\nYoho is refusing responsibility. https://t.co/BKzJa7KUBW

I am deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Naya Rivera.\n\nThe talent and depth Naya brought to her characters inspired millions. As a Latina, it‚Äòs rare to have rich, complex characters reflect us in media. Naya worked hard to give that gift to so many.\n\nQue descanse en paz.
For example, I have heard employers say "we already offer great benefits, why bother unionizing?"\n\nWe offered great benefits too - many of which were ratified in our contract!\n\nA union can also:\na) Protect these benefits, &amp;/or\nb) Establish impt non-monetary rights &amp; protections
This whole process was really eye-opening &amp; I learned a lot!\n\nAs a nonprofit employee &amp; a waitress, I always worked in right-to-work places. Seeing the power of a union up close was inspiring.\n\nI also gained insight into anti-union arguments, which is helpful for countering them.
From living wages to parental leave, it's always been impt to me that wherever possible, my campaign walks the walk.\n\nI'm proud to say that Team AOC is a union shop!\n\nSome deets:\n- $18/hr min\n- Overtime\n- Childcare benefit\n- Healthcare\n- Paid leave\n- Immigrant &amp; Trans protections https://t.co/U0H8MCHUke
It's not as though a vote happens and the full sum of money disappears the next day. That not how it works.\n\nPeople who study crime know that (despite how many pundits pretend otherwise), *causes of crime are complex* and there are few neat and tidy causal relationships.
None of these policing reductions have even *happened yet.*\n\nSo a spike is happening WITH a $6 billion dollar NYPD budget.\n\nYou either know this &amp; are intentionally lying, or you‚Äòre a bad spokeswoman &amp; haven't verified your claims.\n\nGiven your work with @NRA it's probably both. https://t.co/vHtq04ei86
It's our real life.\n\nWhile it takes months, sometimes years to study crime data, I personally can tell you that fed &amp; state relief is NOT reaching people.\n\nWe aren't getting stimulus checks (mixed status fams), millions can't pay rent, &amp; summer youth employment has been cut. /7
I take this issue seriously. Unlike many of GOP pundits theorizing from suburban homes, I've had multiple family members shot, shot at, stabbed, etc.\n\nCrime + community violence isn't some thought experiment to project your thoughts &amp; theories abt communities you've never met. /6
Mind you, there are entire TV series glamorizing, humanizing, and sympathizing White Americans in this exact situation of selling drugs to live - Weeds, Breaking Bad, etc.\n\nBut fact is, Black &amp; Brown communities have been in this predicament forever &amp; get called "animals." /5
For Black &amp; Brown communities, especially in the era of criminalization, the choice to sell weed of course is a risky one - not just w/ police, but with those you get tied up with.\n\nYet when a teenage boy believes the other option is homelessness, they may take the chance. /4
It's virtually impossible to pay rent on $8/hr.\n\nAnd when you are teenage boy in a fatherless home (his dad passed away), there is a drive to be "the man of the house." To help your mom.\n\nAnd what makes money fast when a full time job doesn't pay enough to live? Selling weed. /3
Let me give you a real life example that I've encountered often (wording vaguely to protect people).\n\nGrowing up I was friends w/ a boy who was the son of a single mom. They struggled to pay rent.\n\nAs we know, hourly work doesn't pay a living wage - especially then. /2
Republicans are all upset that I'm connecting the dots between poverty and crime.\n\nI know most of them haven't experienced or seen these issues first hand, but I have.\n\nThis may be hard for them to admit, but poverty and crime are highly linked, both violent &amp; nonviolent alike. https://t.co/4t34dCLZlw

I have an entire TV network dedicated to stoking hatred of me. A white supremacist w/ a popular network show regularly distorts me in dangerous ways, &amp; it's a normal part of my existence to get death threats from their audience.\n\nYou don't see me complaining abt "cancel culture"
The term "cancel culture" comes from entitlement - as though the person complaining has the right to a large, captive audience,&amp; one is a victim if people choose to tune them out.\n\nOdds are you're not actually cancelled, you're just being challenged, held accountable, or unliked.
People who are actually "cancelled" don't get their thoughts published and amplified in major outlets.\n\nThis has been a public service announcement.
Get yourself friends like these: this tweet wasn't up for TWO MINUTES when my friend hit me up with the recipe.

Folks can't pay rent &amp; our GOP Senate + Trump are lighting the match for our housing crisis to explode. üß®\n\nNY: we're going to help teach you how to defend yourself from eviction.\n\nJoin me, @JamaalBowmanNY &amp; @housing4allNY for an eviction defense workshop:\nhttps://t.co/B0fbfgCze6
Above all, I keep hearing that booming voice of our forever Chairman Elijah Cummings.\n\nHe had a mantra of sorts for us: "be efficient and effective." He operated w/ precision &amp;was one of the best leaders I've ever seen. A master. I hope he'd be satisfied to see today's SC ruling.
What I love about the work of @OversightDems is that it‚Äòs investigatory &amp; collaborative, w/ rippling effects.\n\nIt's slow work, but that's what makes it so gratifying - the committee will spend months, sometimes years laying groundwork that contributes to huge moments &amp; shifts. /2
One of my first hearings in Congress was of Michael Cohen, called in by Chairman Cummings.\n\nHere‚¨áÔ∏è Cohen testified that Trump manipulated his assets,&amp; that we need to see his taxes.\n\n@OversightDems is some of my fav work in Congress. It's a slow burn, but yields major results. /1 https://t.co/zPongFKfc3
@mmcauliff Sunrise was represented on the task force w/ @VarshPrakash
@mcbyrne Yes, each Task Force had varying space in which we were able to advance positions.\n\nUltimately, VP is the nominee &amp; will hold positions we disagree w/(or find baffling!).\n\nBut that's okay. The gains are great precommitments, the losses aren't veto threats-organizing can still win
Of course, like in any collaborative effort, there are areas of negotiation and compromise.\n\nBut I do believe that the Climate Task Force effort meaningfully &amp; substantively improved Biden's positions.\n\nI encourage you to engage the document critically and offer feedback or Qs.
The Climate Task Force has agreed to elevate Biden's climate standards across the board &amp; adopt a whole-of-gov mobilization, incl:\n- Ambitious construction, mass transit, &amp; transport, &amp; ag standards+investment\n- Creating millions of good jobs\n- Centering climate justice standards
Today the 6 Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces are unveiling final language.\n\nThe Climate Task Force accomplished a great deal. It was an honor to serve as co-chair w/ Sec. @JohnKerry.\n\nAmong the notable gains: we shaved *15 years* off Biden's previous target for 100% clean energy. https://t.co/pnLj7uufeg
Yes @GOPLeader, @IlhanMN has long been on the side of dismantling systems of oppression &amp; structural racism, as she stated.\n\nIt‚Äòs revealing that *YOU* equated "oppression" w/ "our entire system" as you intentionally took a Black Congresswoman's words out of context to target her. https://t.co/8U00MDCZVP
Is it me, or is the GOP losing their touch with the conspiracy-theory-as-campaign-rhetoric technique?
Yes, that is precisely why the party nominated... Joe Biden https://t.co/ZFx5YAnd9b

Vanessa Guillen's family deserves justice.\n\nWhat happened to her, and to so many victims of sexual harassment and assault in the military, is utterly unacceptable.\n\nWe need an independent investigation. Thank you @RepSylviaGarcia for leading the charge. https://t.co/ScubfNak9k
@ZerlinaMaxwell Ahh! I'll be mindful of that when the character count allows üòÇ
Maxwell's arrest is a significant development.\n\nI hope the SDNY and all relevant parties have conducted an extensive review of the failures of Epstein's custody to ensure Maxwell's safety as this case bears out. https://t.co/5o5HqwJskO
Guess who's repeal of the Faircloth Amendment just passed the House! üòå \n\nFaircloth has blocked construction of new public housing in the United States for 20+ YEARS.

One of the ways the GOP articulates their racism today is their idea that some citizens are "real" people and others aren't.\n\nThis is the argument they make against DC statehood: that this largely Black community doesn't qualify as "real people."\n\nSo, who is a "real" person? ü§î https://t.co/QzyKjH6UGF
