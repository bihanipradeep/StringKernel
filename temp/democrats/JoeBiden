Last night reinforced why I got into this race: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and it's a battle we must win.

I took the Amtrak from Wilmington to Washington, D.C., every day for 36 years. The journey became routine, but the hardworking men and women I met along the way became dear friends. https://t.co/kyikjGKFQ9

One month until we can call @DrBiden our First Lady-Elect. https://t.co/Yi6wxsonYP
It's time we come together. It's time we see each other as fellow Americans, who don't just live in red states and blue states, but who live in — and love — the United States of America. That's who we are — and there is nothing we cannot do if we do it together.
One month until Election Day. Let's do this, America.
Be a patriot. Do your part. Wearing a mask will protect you. But it will also protect those around you — your mom, your dad, your son, your daughter, your neighbor, your co-worker. Don't just do it for yourself. Do it for the people you love.
We have to come together. https://t.co/P8SkE6vkX1
Thank you, Grand Rapids, for a great afternoon. From the virus to the economy, we face immense challenges as a nation. But if we come together and act as one America, we can and will overcome them. https://t.co/eY5FVKRv3K
I'm running as a Democrat, but I will be an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you.
We can, we will, and we must come together.
This cannot be a partisan moment. It must be an American moment. We have to come together as a nation.

I'm happy to report that Jill and I have tested negative for COVID. Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern. I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.
Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.
Donald Trump will do everything he can to distract from the fact that because of his failed COVID-19 response: - Over 200,000 Americans have died - 26 million are on unemployment - 1 in 6 small businesses risk permanent closure We can't let him.
When I first ran for Senate, we put up a billboard that said, "Joe Biden: For all our families." It's a motto that has guided me throughout my career. It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or Republican—I'll be a president for all Americans, not just the ones who vote for me.
On Native Women's Equal Pay Day, we recognize the hard truth that Native women earn just $0.57 for every dollar a white man makes. It's unacceptable. A Biden-Harris Administration will stand with women in Indian Country and pass legislation to close the gender wage gap. https://t.co/RstWRwFc2J
During Filipino American History Month, we celebrate the community's immense contributions to our country — from early immigrants to the millions today, many who serve in the military or as frontline workers. As President, I'll work alongside them to protect the American people.
Three years ago today, Las Vegas was struck by tragedy when a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. As we remember those we lost, we must take action to ensure it never happens again.
Jill and I wish a happy Mid-Autumn Festival to all those celebrating. We join you in hoping for a future filled with peace and prosperity — and hope your festivities lead to a bountiful harvest in the year ahead.
Jill and I want to wish a very happy birthday to President Carter –– a patriot, a humanitarian, and a friend. Thank you for your tireless dedication to our country and to the world. https://t.co/SrajBmltek
On behalf of Jill and our entire family, I want to wish the Korean-American community a happy Chuseok. May your celebrations be filled with laughter, joy, and plenty of good food. 행복한 한가위 보내세요!

It's safe to say I've gotten to know the hardworking men and women of @Amtrak over the years — I'm proud to stand with them as they face furloughs due to funding cuts. These essential workers have kept us moving during this pandemic –– now it's time we have their backs. https://t.co/aoaTYZdhoF

Folks, we don't have to put up with four more years of that. https://t.co/aIt2BNuQg3
You have it in your control to determine what this country's gonna look like the next four years. Is it going to change –– or are you going to get four more years of these lies? https://t.co/eoxT07uII9

You determine the outcome of this election. Vote. Vote. Vote. https://t.co/Ros3XuU16k
Under this president, we have become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession, I was asked to fix it, and I did. We left Donald Trump a booming economy, and he caused a recession. https://t.co/uEMPaTtZ7F
Go to: https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
Under this president, we've become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent.
Beau Biden was not a loser. https://t.co/hwzlZrjh75
Donald Trump isn't a law and order president. He's a president who breaks the law and creates disorder.
Donald Trump talks a lot about the art of the deal. But under his watch, China has perfected the art of the steal. https://t.co/OSTsHHTtBQ
More jobs were created in the final three years of the Obama-Biden Administration than in the first three years of Donald Trump's presidency. A million and a half more jobs. https://t.co/3Y75JhJY0n
On average, roughly 750 to 1,000 Americans are dying from COVID every day. When Donald Trump was presented with that number, he said, "It is what it is." It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is. https://t.co/OOm2pVRijz
Show us your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump.
Donald Trump is the worst president we've ever had.
When I hear 200,000 deaths, I think of the empty chairs at dining room tables all across the country, which just months ago were filled by loved ones. It didn't have to be this bad.
It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is.
The American people deserve to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. https://t.co/jnFXiDkt2c
President Trump keeps promising to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he's in Court trying to rip their protections away. And now, he's trying to jam through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him get it done. We can't let him win.
I'm about to step on stage to debate Donald Trump for the first time. But before I do, can you chip in to show him the power of our grassroots base? Every donation — big or small — goes a long way. https://t.co/HiNSLIqIPQ

If we're elected, @KamalaHarris and I will wake up every single morning to fight for the middle class. For Main Street. For the folks who keep our country running. We're going to make our government work for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
You deserve a president who tells you the truth. https://t.co/YcIMDYZr66
It's grassroots donors like you who power our campaign. And I'm counting on you to help us meet our end-of-quarter fundraising goal. If you're able, please chip in before tomorrow night's big deadline: https://t.co/JDpr6U0evX
The American people deserve transparency from their leaders, it's why as of today, I've released 22 years of my tax returns. https://t.co/6fwL20fWeI
With casualties rapidly mounting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, the Trump Administration needs to call the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan immediately to de-escalate the situation. It must also demand others — like Turkey — stay out of this conflict. https://t.co/C41YKEGTyA
The American people understand the urgency of this moment. They're voting in droves because their health care hangs in the balance. But Donald Trump doesn't care — he sees a chance to eliminate Obamacare and rip away health care protections from millions. It's unconscionable.
I believe there's no greater economic engine in the world than the hard work and ingenuity of the American people — and I witnessed it firsthand last week in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Together, we're going to make sure the future is made here in America. https://t.co/tw7tv6sPKT
Folks, this is a big week for our campaign: Tomorrow, I face Donald Trump on the debate stage for the first time — and Wednesday is our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline. We can't afford to fall short here. Chip in today: https://t.co/PBlWnV8pBr

I'm not looking to punish anyone, but it's about time the super-wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share.
Whether it's $7.50, $75, or $750 — every donation makes a big difference during this final stretch. Chip in to help us get Donald Trump out of the White House: https://t.co/ttsZXljWG1
President Trump can claim he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions all he wants — but the fact is he's fighting tooth and nail to take their protections away.
How much more did you pay in taxes than President Trump? Head to https://t.co/h9ZZ0iBuiE to find out. https://t.co/w689uVoHq7
Here's the deal: Until we deal with COVID-19, we'll never get our economy fully back on track, get our kids safely back to school, or get our lives back. It's why as president, I won't waste a day getting this virus under control. https://t.co/xjxsDmKPe3
There's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the Supreme Court. President Trump and Republicans have been trying to throw out Obamacare for years — and now they see an opening to get it done. We can't let them get away with it.
On this Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, Jill and I are keeping the loved ones of our fallen heroes in our prayers. May we never fail to honor them and carry their spirit with us every day.
Jill, Kamala, Doug, and our families all extend our warmest wishes to all who observe Yom Kippur. May you have an easy and meaningful fast. And may you be sealed in the Book of Life. https://t.co/z4EMRDH8Y5
The truth is the economy wasn't working for folks long before these crises hit. It's why @KamalaHarris and I won't just build back to the way things were — we'll build back better. We won't be satisfied until the economy starts working for everyone.
The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court affect our everyday lives — and the American people deserve to have their voices heard when it comes to who serves on the Court. Tune in as I deliver remarks on President Trump's nomination. https://t.co/N9HmjDXKMw
These folks know that we can't saddle this country with four more years of Donald Trump. https://t.co/6a3GAHCPyC
Thank you @TheRock for your support at this critical moment for our nation. You said it best: This election is about earning the respect of the American people. It's about decency. It's about electing leaders who tell the truth. Thanks again, DJ. Next time we're talking cars. https://t.co/V5kHR5fQbe
In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump is trying to force through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him destroy Obamacare. Health care is at stake. Protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake. We can't let them win. https://t.co/zIdPmxzYtQ
The Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do.
Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions. The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress. Americans deserve to be heard.
Today, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court — a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court's decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. Vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is. https://t.co/TDBQOVLP4K
When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus. After COVID-19 hit, President Trump lied to the American people and said it would miraculously "disappear. " ow, over 200,000 lives have been cut short. It's a national tragedy.
At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change. We need a president who believes in science.
Today is Public Lands Day and National Hunting and Fishing Day — and what better way to celebrate than the long overdue removal of William Perry Pendley from @blmnational. It's a victory for everyone who values our public lands over those who want to exploit them for profit. https://t.co/lZxDF4PzH6
If I'm elected, I won't wait to take action on COVID-19. Minutes after the race is called, I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. During my transition, I'll bring together experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward. We will overcome this, together.
Thanks for a great trip, Minnesota! Don't forget that early voting is now open across the state. Head to https://t.co/7PghlU2FSm to make your plan to vote today. https://t.co/xRLkPOGwcr
Today, Justice Ginsburg made history one last time — and I was grateful to be there to pay my respects. May her memory be a blessing — and may we continue to be voices for justice in her name. https://t.co/TMJeYw0d89
The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us. It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating. It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office — to care, for everyone.
We are in the middle of a climate emergency — and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet. We have to vote him out. https://t.co/NkSJ7bvBoE
Obamacare was—and is—a big deal. As president, I'll protect and build on it, lower health care costs, and give Americans the opportunity to choose a new public option. We're going to make sure everyone has access to the affordable health care they need. https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
Health care is a right — not a privilege.
In the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. Don't forget that.
Thank you, @CindyMcCain. Your support and your friendship mean the world to me. John and I didn't always agree on the issues, but we put aside our differences to find common ground and move the country forward — it's what I'll do every day as president. https://t.co/KheAlsKt73
I've spent my career working to end violence against women and will fight to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. I applaud Congress for passing Savanna's Act this week. ow, the Senate and President Trump need to reauthorize VAWA. It's long overdue. https://t.co/Xru7YzAUBD
Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better.
The Trump Administration says "the entire ACA must fall. " They are arguing to strip millions of Americans of health care in the middle of a pandemic. We can't let him win. https://t.co/bcwiGz1HOn
In-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. The Flint, MI City Clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before Election Day for folks to cast their ballots. It's an example that cities and states across the country should follow.

Even amidst the profound grief  anger today's decision generated, violence is never  can never be the answer. Those who engage in it must be held accountable. Jill  I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift  full recovery.
The 200,000 people we've lost to COVID-19 weren't nobodies, Mr. President. They were our parents and grandparents, sons and daughters, friends and co-workers. They were Americans. https://t.co/EcdaEiwgUS

Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue. I see the world from where I grew up: Scranton, Pennsylvania.
It didn't have to be this bad. https://t.co/R2WqNeauiu
200,000 Americans have died from this virus. It's a staggering number that's hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same. There's a devastating human toll to this pandemic — and we can't forget that.
While other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing. ow, nearly 200,000 Americans have died. It didn't have to happen this way. https://t.co/RqdLtARlRW
Today, we'll pass another grim milestone in this pandemic: 200,000 American lives lost. Jill and I are keeping everyone who's hurting in our prayers. No words can numb your pain, but know the nation grieves with you. Today is dark, but we will overcome this. Keep the faith.
Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country — and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.
When the virus came, President Trump wasn't thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection. It's how Trump looks at the world: It's always about him, never about us. You deserve a president who will put you first.

Honor and decency are on the ballot this November. https://t.co/pWmWySJAs5
It was my honor to preside over Justice Ginsburg's confirmation hearings, and to support her accession to the Supreme Court. Her opinions, and her dissents, will shape the basis of our law for generations to come — and we'll be a more just and equal nation because of it. https://t.co/SmZD2KyyyG
I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message. https://t.co/TuRZXPE5xK
We must win.
The Supreme Court is on the ballot. And the outcome will impact everything from health care to civil rights — affecting generations to come. Vote. Our future depends on it. https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for all of us. She was a giant of the Court and unflinching in her pursuit of equal justice under the law. Because of her life's work, we are closer to that more perfect union we've always strived to be. https://t.co/o30ZCuj10G
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us all. https://t.co/vQQiB1oQ2J
Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise.
Jill and I wish our friends in the Jewish community a very healthy and happy New Year. As we mark this new beginning, let us commit to pursuing peace and justice in the year ahead. #RoshHashanah

I can't believe I have to say this, but if I'm elected president, I won't put a climate change denier — one who called the scientific community "a bunch of thugs " — in charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. https://t.co/FcRtv8ZcYS
When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us. When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing. When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found. It's unforgivable.
Donald Trump claimed he would be "the greatest jobs president God ever created. " But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history. We can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. https://t.co/uW10KJhMsV
Folks, I just wrapped up my first CNN Town Hall of the general election. We're in the home stretch of this campaign and your support matters more than ever. Chip in to help us keep tonight's momentum going: https://t.co/J2E4dtxGEK
What the hell makes you think I need an Ivy League degree to be president? #BidenTownHall https://t.co/fzoMjYTlZ4
Unlike President Trump, I'll be a president for all Americans — not just the ones who vote for me. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/2lttWNRl5n
Here's the deal: I've condemned every form of violence, no matter what the source is. President Trump has not. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/kqoaJRLYMn

The choice in this election couldn't be more clear. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's dark and divisive politics. Or we can choose a path of hope and light—and build a better future for all. Chip in to help us win. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/a1aSMb7x1G

I'm about to take the stage for tonight's Town Hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Tune in to @CNN now to watch live. https://t.co/zi0P1gcAiU
Donald Trump wants to give his rich friends another tax cut, so they pay a lower tax rate than tens of millions of essential workers and middle class Americans. We need a president who cares about more than the wealthy and well-connected.
I'm looking forward to being back in my home town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for tonight's CNN Town Hall. Tune in at 8 PM ET to watch. https://t.co/yHez7c4gaq
No surprise, Donald Trump is lying about my tax plan. Here's the truth about how I'll make corporations pay their fair share while ensuring Americans making under $400,000 don't pay a penny more. https://t.co/0cpJjpCS33
Ahead of #RoshHashanah, Jill and I want to wish everyone in the Jewish community a very happy, healthy, and sweet New Year. Tune in to our virtual event: https://t.co/ECEfGRqX5n
The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis. ow, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break. Let that sink in.
If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president. The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families. We're going to reward work — not wealth.
.@realDonaldTrump, the job is to be president of all Americans. For the love of God start acting like it. https://t.co/kkHf9aWZmR
We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing. We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine. The stakes are too high.
Yesterday, I met with some of our nation's top experts to discuss how we distribute a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. If I win this election, I know that there won't be a minute to waste. I'll get to work on day one implementing an effective distribution plan. https://t.co/GfgSnBwjTQ
President Trump promised the opioid crisis would end "quickly " if he won, but the fact is drug overdose deaths are up nearly 10% across the country. It's heartbreaking. As president, I promise I'll take action to end this epidemic. https://t.co/tnVAqXbXpm

We've lost nearly 200,000 Americans to COVID-19. It didn't have to be this bad — but Donald Trump failed to do his job.

Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico — but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria. It's unacceptable. As president, I'll support the island's full recovery and invest in its people and future.

As we celebrate the Independence Day of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, we must affirm the democratic aspirations and human rights of people across Latin America. I'll always fight for democracy and for those who come to America seeking a better life.
The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing is a powerful reminder of our past and what remains at stake in this election. As we honor the memory of those four little girls, we must commit to defeating the poisonous ideology of white supremacy that lit the fuse 57 years ago.

I promise that as president, I'll make reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act a top priority and continue working to end gender-based violence. https://t.co/wmN7bSAUVg
With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger. The latest bill—passed by the House last year—would close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for Native women. But Mitch McConnell refuses to bring it to the floor for a vote. It's despicable.
26 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. In the years since, it has saved countless lives and helped change the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence. Writing and championing the law remains one of my proudest accomplishments. https://t.co/9pV7X9fgKq
It's hard to believe, but Monday marks 50 days until Election Day. To kick off the final stretch, @HillaryClinton and @KamalaHarris are hosting a grassroots fundraiser. You won't want to miss this, folks. Chip in to reserve your spot: https://t.co/WI4clZqxEA
26 years ago today, the Senate passed 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—it was an effort I was proud to champion. These bans saved lives, and Congress should have never let them expire. As president, I'll take on the @NRA and we'll ban them once again.
This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice. Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished. Jill and I are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery. https://t.co/330QfeIUGg

Iran's cruel execution of Navid Afkari is a travesty. No country should arrest, torture, or execute peaceful protestors or activists. Iran must free its other political prisoners, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, and release unjustly detained Americans. https://t.co/Jj9QZbyQL7
As president, I'll impose a tax penalty on companies that ship jobs overseas and sell products back to the U.S. — and I'll create millions of good-paying jobs here at home. We're going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America's workers. https://t.co/8smOm5MGx1
The science is clear, and deadly signs like the fires out West are unmistakable — climate change poses an existential threat to our way of life. We must act now to avoid a future defined by tragedies like the one American families are enduring today. https://t.co/iGNTQVOy3t
You deserve a President and Vice President who will spend every minute of every day working to make your life better. I promise that's exactly what @KamalaHarris and I will do.

And now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation — so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.
Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service.
This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss — a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans.
Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of Americans in every corner of the country. https://t.co/6rAF0dAd1Y
As a nation, we must never forget those we lost on 9/11 and the incredible bravery of our first responders. Though the wounds of that day will never fully heal, the spirit of Americans recovered as it always does — unbowed by the efforts of those who strike against it. https://t.co/Ogn7Sbvq1Q
Donald Trump said he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. We didn't need a cheerleader. We needed a president.

Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today—while also refusing to fully fund their National Guard. These are frontline workers against COVID-19, responsible for testing and distributing food and medical supplies. Michiganders need a pandemic response—not a pep rally. https://t.co/UkEqVv9zXe
Do your part. Wear a mask. https://t.co/pdnEecS49Q

Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.
I got to meet Lou Brock back in March. I joked that I had really just come to St. Louis to see him—and let me tell you, our meeting was a real highlight. Lou was a true legend and a man of integrity. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers during this difficult time. https://t.co/ZStoBAnk7V
Donald Trump knew that COVID-19 was dangerous. He knew it was deadly. And he purposely downplayed it. ow, nearly 200,000 Americans are dead. It's unconscionable. https://t.co/SLqqhmWy8E
You deserve a president who tells you the truth.
If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone. Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin. It's an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.
Roberto Clemente was an incredible baseball player. He was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. As he rose to fame, he lifted the Black and Latino communities with him. I may be a Phillies fan, but I'm always proud to honor the legacy of #21. https://t.co/ZWSfIBUD0p
I promise you that if I'm elected, I'll always tell you the truth. I'll listen to the experts and do everything I can to contain this virus. And I'll always put your health and safety first — no matter the political cost.
Donald Trump knew. He lied to us for months. And while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job — on purpose. It was a life or death betrayal of the American people. https://t.co/WDmVUvmmJk

Given his track record, no one can take Trump's word alone on a COVID-19 vaccine. But with satisfactory answers to these questions, every American can have confidence in a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. https://t.co/074K1HD9wf
3: What is the plan to allocate and distribute vaccines to Americans cost-free, safely, equitably, and without politics? President Trump should release a detailed distribution plan to ensure every American — not just the wealthy and well-connected — receives the vaccine.
2: Who will validate that the Administration's decision to greenlight a COVID-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation? We must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from @FDACBER, the @US_FDA vaccine advisory committee, and Dr. Fauci.
1: What criteria will be used to ensure a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and efficacy? The FDA must clarify what criteria it will use, and President Trump must commit to respecting the independent judgment of the non-political professional staff at the FDA.
A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine could save countless lives. We need one as soon as possible. But while I see a vaccine as a product of science, President Trump sees it as a political tool. Politics should play no role in this. The Administration must answer the following:
Donald Trump is incapable of providing the leadership this moment requires.

Wall Street didn't build this country — the middle class did. And unions built the middle class. Donald Trump doesn't understand that. We need a president who does.
It's not enough to just thank our essential workers — we need to pay them. As president, I'll: - Raise the minimum wage to $15 - End the tipped minimum wage - End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities - Ensure everyone has strong benefits
For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions. It will end on my watch. I'll sign the PRO Act — making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain — and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.
Together, we can build a future that reflects working people's courage and ambition. One that not only offers good jobs — but the dignity, equity, shared prosperity, and common purpose due to every American. https://t.co/FDLGMKCgWD

The fact is we're more than six months into this pandemic, and: - 11.5 million Americans don't have their jobs back - Almost 30 million are on unemployment - We're down 720,000 manufacturing jobs - Nearly 1 in 6 small businesses have closed their doors
I'm grateful for everyone who found work in August and found that glimmer of hope — but there is real cause for concern in this morning's jobs report. The pace of job gains in August was slower than in July. And significantly slower than May or June.

We need a president who will lower the temperature and bring the country together — not one who raises it and tears us further apart. https://t.co/e6aFLx9iqU
Our nation is at an inflection point. @KamalaHarris and I sat down to discuss what brought us to this moment — and how we move forward and build back better than before. Tune in to watch: https://t.co/PlmeffTySN
Across the country, people rely on public transportation to get to work, see loved ones, and access essential services. But that's all under threat because Republicans refuse to do their jobs. Congress must act now to save public transit.
Today's press conference made it clear: we are all less safe because Donald Trump has failed at his job. We need a President who will stop violence — not incite it. https://t.co/AhGNZCDQkr
President Shri Pranab Mukherjee was a devout public servant who believed deeply in the importance of our two nations tackling global challenges together. Jill and I are saddened to hear of his passing — our prayers go out to his loved ones and the Indian people. https://t.co/SJfaDEKjGi
I urge President Trump to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is an important right — violence is wrong. Period. If he can't say that, then he is unfit to be President. https://t.co/W4sjpF0Z3V
Tonight, President Trump declined to rebuke violence. He wouldn't even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder. He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it.
Fear never builds the future — hope does. https://t.co/V0jCGRBBG7
If Donald Trump wants to ask the question: Who will keep you safer as President? Let's answer it. https://t.co/pDXCqzRbQe

More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol. early one in six small businesses in this country are closed. Do you really feel safer under Trump?
Mr. President, it's high time you condemn violence of any form. https://t.co/rQlXyadZid
Donald Trump keeps telling us if he was president, you'd feel safe. Well, he is president — whether he knows it or not.
Trump and Pence are running on this: "You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America." And what's their proof? The violence you're seeing in Donald Trump's America.
The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So now, he's trying to scare America.
I want a safe America — safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops. And let's be crystal clear: Safe from four more years of Donald Trump.
Donald Trump may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is.
Donald Trump can't stop the violence we're seeing today – because for years he has fomented it. Tune in as I discuss the need for justice and safety in America: https://t.co/gSXuP0jc5D
Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?
We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump: COVID. Economic devastation. Unwarranted police violence. Emboldened white nationalists. A reckoning on race. Declining faith in a bright American future. The common thread? A president who makes things worse — not better.
We're going to build back better and we will do it while creating a brighter future for you and your families. This week @KamalaHarris and I sit down to discuss how we are going to move forward—together. Join us on Tuesday. https://t.co/hebSifEEHL

Donald Trump has been president for almost four years. The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper. And all of us are less safe because he can't do the job of the American president.
We must not become a country at war with ourselves. A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance toward one another. But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.
The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable. Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable. I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same. https://t.co/JRuI7ya2Wv

America was built on a simple idea: All men — and women — are created equal. It's time we ensured all people are treated equally as well.
The President incites violence, inspires white-supremacist shooters, and his failed COVID response is costing thousands of lives per day. When you look at the world right now, ask yourself: Do you feel safe in Trump's America? https://t.co/Ztp6TdSwKk
America is at an inflection point. The calls for racial justice that sparked the March on Washington 57 years ago are ringing out again today.

As we mark the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream " speech, we must continue the hard work of perfecting our union. It's up to all of us to carry on the march toward equality, liberty, and justice for all.

Mr. President, Americans are canceling weddings and holding funerals without family. They're sacrificing so more Americans don't have to die. But instead of leading by example, you hosted a super spreader event on the South Lawn. When will you take the presidency seriously? https://t.co/DcVUGsZ9a5
We can't let George Floyd and Jacob Blake become just another pair of hashtags. This is a moment of action. It's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer.

Donald Trump calls himself a wartime president. But now, instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he's waved the white flag. He abandoned the American people when we needed him most.
When President Trump took office, he inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And just like everything else he's inherited in his life, he squandered it. https://t.co/tTBD8lRC1c
President Trump has failed our nation. https://t.co/w792IB79kK

When Donald Trump says tonight you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump's America?
This news is deeply disturbing — as an alum of @UDelaware and as an American. We need a full and swift investigation into what happened Tuesday night. With anti-Semitism on the rise across the country, we all have a moral obligation to speak out and give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/YofvhFv6wA

The truth is, there's not a lot of people whose opinion I valued more than Beau's. When I was deciding who to pick as my running mate, I thought a lot about his friendship with @KamalaHarris and the respect he had for her. I know he'd be proud of my choice. https://t.co/Lv9E0KgwZG
They say choosing your running mate is the most important decision you make when you're running for president. Well, I'm confident I made the right choice. Tonight, @KamalaHarris speaks directly to America. Tune in at 9 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/0kFuobs91Z
You are the rock of our family, Jilly. I am and have always been in awe of you. https://t.co/JjoUGatdWn
When it comes down to it, Kamala and Doug share the same basic values set that Jill and I do — and it all starts with family. It's at the very core of who we are. And it's why I'm confident they're the best possible partners for the road ahead. https://t.co/VXkmeyOybY
We have the power to write the future we want for this country — and it starts at the ballot box this November. Register to vote today and let's get to work: https://t.co/Hy8C4n0lUk https://t.co/os2A8lhMIT
The brave citizens of Belarus are showing their voices will not be silenced by terror or torture. The U.S. should support Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's call for fair elections. Russia must be told not to interfere—this is not about geopolitics but the right to choose one's leaders.
I might be a little biased, but I think @DrBiden gave the best speech in convention history last night. Check it out along with other highlights from night two of the #DemConvention: https://t.co/ZbwPoFYiMw
Tonight made one thing clear: We need to restore real leadership to the White House — and we need to do it now. Chip in to help us make it happen. https://t.co/4o4OT4ugJn

Jill loves fiercely, cares deeply, and nothing stops her when she sets her mind to making something right. For all of you across the country, just think of your favorite educator who gave you the confidence to believe in yourself. That's the kind of First Lady Jill will be.
John McCain was a good man, and a good friend. He made this country better. I miss him dearly. #DemConvention https://t.co/TZ4cRY5fz4
Thank you, @AdyBarkan for your courage and for all that you do to ensure a more just, more equal America. #DemConvention https://t.co/JDqhwK719L
It is the honor of my life to accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States of America. #DemConvention
Jacquelyn: Your nomination means the world to me. Thank you — and I hope you know: we love you back. #DemConvention https://t.co/BDS1HQAxhM
.@SallyQYates is right: This president has done nothing but use his position to benefit himself rather than our country #DemConvention https://t.co/xgTEA2MYWs
I remember helping President Carter with his campaign back when I was a first-term Senator. I'm deeply honored to have his support today. Thank you, Mr. President. #DemConvention https://t.co/P7deAwTbzo
These young leaders represent not just the next generation, but the diversity of our great nation. #DemConvention https://t.co/bKpUrUbC0K
America is an idea stronger than any army and bigger than any ocean. It's more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It offers hope. #DemConvention https://t.co/93R8wxNzUk
Last night, folks from across the country came together to show how much stronger we are when we stand united. Looking forward to tonight where we'll talk about why leadership matters, and hear from my favorite #DemConvention speaker, @DrBiden. https://t.co/7nunEqhK9C
