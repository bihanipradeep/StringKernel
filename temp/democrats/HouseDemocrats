3.6 million cases. Over 140,000 deaths. Enough is ENOUGH.\n\nHouse Democrats passed the #HeroesAct two months ago and STILL @senatemajldr refuses to take action.
The fight for equality includes participating in the #2020Census. \n\nFrom school and hospital funding to representation in Congress, the census touches every part of everyday life. Make sure your community receives the resources it deserves. \nhttps://t.co/B03g57Dwor
After six months of battling #COVID19, cases are continuing to surge across the country. Tens of millions are out of work. Hundreds of thousands are grieving their loved ones.\n\nAll of this could have been prevented. But this administration chose to distract and deny.
Dear Mr. Lewis,\n \nYour journey for justice began when you were just 17 years old. You were arrested and attacked countless times--but never stopped fighting for equality.\n \nYou are a legend, a hero and a friend.\n \nYou changed our world for the better. Thank you.\n \n#GoodTrouble https://t.co/EpSnLoRJ9V

Make no mistake: Voter suppression is a crisis in this country and #COVID19 only makes it harder for Americans to get to the polls. \n\nOur country needs a national plan to vote by mail.
Let's be clear: The #ClimateCrisis has disproportionately affected people of color and low-income communities.\n\nThat's why House Democrats are focused on solutions that will protect our planet and create good-paying jobs by investing in communities that have been left behind.
Protecting and expanding health care. Creating good-paying jobs. Rebuilding neglected infrastructure. Tackling police brutality. Defending justice and equality. \n\nHouse Democrats have been fighting #ForThePeople since DAY ONE. Where is @senatemajldr?
Our roads and bridges are crumbling. Our schools are falling apart. Our infrastructure is in CRISIS.\n\nHouse Democrats passed the #MovingForwardAct to improve the safety and mobility of our nation's infrastructure #ForThePeople.
Every single one of us has a responsibility to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.\n\nThat starts with wearing a mask.
House Democrats have been clear since day one: Protecting and expanding health care is our top priority. Full stop.
House Democrats have successfully passed #COVID19 relief measures for American families, workers, health care professionals and small businesses. \n\nBut the country needs more. That's why we passed the #HeroesAct.\n\nAmerica is waiting, @senatemajldr.
Countless brave Americans have fought and died for their right to vote. Change is LONG overdue.\n\nHouse Democrats are fighting to ensure EVERY American has full and equal access to this fundamental right.
The Trump administration has continued its relentless attacks on health care during a deadly pandemic. There is no rock bottom. \n\nHouse Democrats will ALWAYS fight to expand and protect access to quality, affordable health care.
Participating in the #2020Census is one of the easiest ways to help your community.\n\nMake sure you #GetCounted. \nhttps://t.co/B03g57Dwor
House Democrats are focused on #SolvingTheClimateCrisis through real, action-oriented solutions that will:\n\n⬆️ Grow our economy and create good-paying jobs\n🏘️ Build more just and resilient communities\n✨ Reduce pollution and protect clean air and water
Let's be clear: Systemic racism is real. Dismantling it will take bold action and political courage. \n\nThat's why House Democrats passed the #GeorgeFloyd Justice in Policing Act. Transforming our nation's police departments is an important step on the long road toward justice.
From lowering health care costs to fighting racial injustice, from creating good-paying jobs to tackling the climate crisis, from rebuilding our nation's infrastructure to getting the money out of politics—House Democrats have been fighting #ForThePeople since DAY ONE.
No American should have to choose between putting food on the table and taking care of their health. \n\nThat's why House Democrats are fighting for quality, affordable health care for ALL. #ForThePeople
There is no denying that systemic racism has destroyed communities, denied opportunities and taken lives.\n\nHouse Democrats passed the #GeorgeFloyd Justice in Policing Act to transform our nation's policing system and push our country one step further on the road to equality.
House Democrats passed the #HeroesAct to provide additional relief to our nation's essential workers and small businesses.\n\nBut @senatemajldr chose to ignore the cries of the American people.
The facts are clear: Our planet is dying. \n\nHouse Democrats are fighting for #ClimateAction that makes our communities safer, healthier, more resilient and more just.
House Democrats came to Washington with one goal: to fight #ForThePeople.\n\nThat has not changed.

Wear a mask.\n\nThat's it. That's the tweet.
We've said it before, and we'll say it again: Health care is a fundamental right. \n\nThe Trump administration clearly doesn't believe that.
Police brutality is a national issue. \n\nNational issues require national solutions. \n\nThat's why House Democrats passed the #GeorgeFloyd Justice in Policing Act.
House Democrats passed the #HeroesAct WEEKS ago.\n\nThe American people need relief.\n\nWhere is @senatemajldr?
Make no mistake: Our roads, bridges, schools and transit systems are in desperate need of repair and upgrade. \n\nHouse Democrats want to invest $1.5 trillion in our nation's infrastructure and create millions of good-paying jobs. #MovingForward
Over 130,000 dead. Tens of millions out of work. Surging #COVID19 cases. \n\nBut the president continues to downplay and distract. \n\nThe country deserves real leadership.
Don't listen to the political noise. \n\nHouse Democrats have passed over 400 bills to lower health care costs, fight racial injustice, create good-paying jobs and so much more. \n\nBut @senatemajldr and @SenateGOP don't want to govern.

Forcing Americans to choose between their health and their right to vote is blatant voter suppression.\n\nAnyone who is against mail-in voting during a deadly pandemic is against democracy.
#COVID19 has highlighted what we already knew: Some in Washington are focused on fighting for their corporate donors and wealthy friends. \n\nHouse Democrats will always put the American people first. Full stop.
It has been WEEKS since House Democrats passed the #HeroesAct to provide much-needed relief to our nation's families, small businesses, health care professionals and essential workers. \n\n@senatemajldr: Step up. Stop ignoring this crisis. The American people need relief.

Health care is a right, not a privilege. \n\nBut the Trump administration has been trying to take away health care from millions of Americans since DAY ONE. \n\nHouse Democrats will ALWAYS fight to #ProtectOurCare.
Let's be clear: This administration had time to prepare for #COVID19. They just chose not to. \n\nOur country deserves real leadership.
Forcing the American people to choose between their right to vote and their health is voter suppression. Full stop.\n\nVote-by-mail is ESSENTIAL to our democracy.
It is clear that some in Washington are fighting for corporate interests and wealthy donors. \n\nBut House Democrats are fighting #ForThePeople. That will never change.
#COVID19 is far from gone. \n\nREMEMBER: Wear a mask when going outside and try to stay at least feet from others. \n\nWe're all in this together.
