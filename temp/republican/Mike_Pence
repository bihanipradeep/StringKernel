I've got news for the Democrats &amp; their friends in Hollywood: The dogma lives loudly in me, it lives loudly in you —and the right to live, work, and worship according to the dictates of our faith and our conscience lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States!
Joe Biden's running mate actually attacked another one of our judges just because he was a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus &amp; the Ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said Judge Barrett's Catholic Faith was "of concern" saying "The dogma lives loudly within you."

Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China throughout his career &amp; he wants to repeal the tariffs that are leveling the playing field for American workers. President Trump is going to keep standing up to China until they put American workers on a level playing field.
Joe Biden has put forth the most extreme platform of any major party candidate in US history. In the middle of a global pandemic he wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion but your President cut taxes for hardworking families &amp; we're going to keep cutting taxes for four more years. https://t.co/UVBfGui6Xj

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever." -Psalm 23
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
In the memory of all those we lost on this day 19 years ago, in memory of the heroes that were forged that day, &amp; heroes forged on battlefields ever since, and for the families, loved ones, &amp; friends they left behind, I pray these ancient words will comfort your hearts and ours. https://t.co/wRgHCcdZ4q

Joe Biden is willing to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of blue-collar jobs for the sake of his radical environmental agenda. With four more years of President @realDonaldTrump, we'll have MORE fracking, more American energy &amp; energy independence for generations to come! https://t.co/FoTFqetrzq
Yesterday, Joe Biden said "I am not banning fracking." Perhaps he's forgotten his own words. At one of his rallies, he told a supporter: "I guarantee, I guarantee, we are going to end fossil fuels." Joe, that includes fracking.
But yesterday, Joe Biden never condemned ANTIFA, never called on Democrat mayors to get their cities under control, and never called out his campaign staff or his running mate for raising money to bail out violent criminals.
Joe Biden doesn't think he looks like a "radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters."
We don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement &amp; standing with our African American neighbors. From the first day of this Administration we've done both &amp; we'll keep supporting law enforcement &amp; supporting our African American community for #FourMoreYears! https://t.co/G7SJe3mTzm

Four more years of President @realDonaldTrump means more jobs, more judges, more support for our Troops and our Cops, and it's going to take at least four more years to DRAIN THAT SWAMP! #MAGA 🇺🇸 https://t.co/eBXdqSpUM6
This President, this Vice President and this party BACK THE BLUE! We will ALWAYS stand with the men and women on the Thin Blue Line! #RNC2020 https://t.co/qz6Ve9yHgk
Joe Biden &amp; the Democratic party have been overtaken by the radical left with an agenda of higher taxes, socialized medicine, open borders, abortion on demand &amp; cutting funding to the men &amp; women of Law Enforcement at every level. We must reelect President @realDonaldTrump! https://t.co/t3MqK9SrOY
In the last three and a half years, we've revived this economy through cutting taxes, rolling back regulations, unleashing American energy, fighting for free and fair trade, and restoring the arsenal of democracy! #MAGA https://t.co/7bF8hw9hNE
https://t.co/xhcvQhO2us
We don't have to choose between supporting Law Enforcement and supporting our African-American community. We have done both. We'll continue to do both. https://t.co/eoqPEqyn20
The American people have a choice between a President who has rebuilt our military, revived our economy, appointed Conservatives to our courts &amp; stood strong with law enforcement vs. Joe Biden &amp; the radical left who support higher taxes, socialized medicine, &amp; abortion on demand. https://t.co/ts6AzldtQJ
We've added teachers to @DHSgov's list of essential workers &amp; they'll be prioritized for things like PPE &amp; support. We want to get our kids back to school but we want teachers to know, we're going to make the resources available so schools can be a safe environment for everyone. https://t.co/CRXzlxAqXG
Last night, we heard about Joe Biden's plan to raise taxes, increase regulation, and take us back to all of the same policies from the last Administration that resulted in the slowest economic recovery since the great depression. https://t.co/BqAyJh3lHy
Coming up next on @CNN: Joining @JohnBerman on @NewDay to talk about the incredible things President @realDonaldTrump has achieved for the American people!
This election is a choice between President @realDonaldTrump's record and agenda of freedom and opportunity versus a Democrat agenda driven by the radical left and Joe Biden's vision that will result in socialism and decline for America. https://t.co/dOQgWbBbCM
Where Joe Biden actually criticized this President for taking out the most dangerous terrorist in the world, Qasem Soleimani, President @realDonaldTrump rebuilt our military, decimated ISIS, took their leader out without one American casualty and stood strong against China. https://t.co/vaH6k9PL1A

Joe Biden hasn't been to Wisconsin in 659 days. https://t.co/Rarb2I4rSe
In just three and a half years under President @realDonaldTrump, businesses large and small created more than 7 million good-paying jobs, 2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty, and 7 million Americans were able to leave food stamps and pursue a better life! https://t.co/8NBa4zCOXI
We didn't need a magic wand. We needed President @realDonaldTrump in the @WhiteHouse. 500,000 manufacturing jobs created in three and half years. American manufacturing is coming BACK under President @realDonaldTrump!
Joe Biden and Barack Obama oversaw the loss of 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And in the summer of 2016, Barack Obama actually said that those jobs were never going to come back. He asked, "What magic wand do you have?"
Joe Biden would bury this economy under an avalanche of red tape, more regulation, &amp; more bureaucracy which would kill Americans jobs! President @realDonaldTrump has cut more federal red tape than any President in HISTORY and created MILLIONS of jobs along the way! https://t.co/Qp012T5eSz

While past admins turned their backs on our farmers &amp; ethanol producers, President @realDonaldTrump told the people of Iowa that this Administration would expand ethanol markets. Once again he delivered on a promise: E-15 is now available year-round! https://t.co/Q8n6xpNDTC
We are FOR American Farmers and Ranchers! Under President @realDonaldTrump, we repealed the Waters of the USA rule and we restored private property rights here in Iowa and all across America! https://t.co/zELwobbXAQ
I was briefed today by @IAGovernor, @joniernst, @MikeNaigIA, and local farmers on Monday's destructive derecho here in Iowa. Like I said to the farmers: President @realDonaldTrump and I are with you and we'll make sure you have what you need to recover from this storm. https://t.co/WJp4cmTAt4

Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris want to raise taxes by $4 trillion, they want to do their own version of the Green New Deal, they're going to appoint activists to our Courts, they support taxpayer funded abortion, they support open borders &amp; they want to cut funding to law enforcement. https://t.co/IJvVlApHpr

Where President Trump has supported law enforcement from day one, Joe Biden &amp; the radical left say we have to choose between supporting police or supporting all families. We don't need to choose. We can do both, we've done both &amp; we'll keeping doing both for #FourMoreYears!
Joe Biden said not long ago that well-armed police become the enemy when confronting lawlessness in our streets.

This weekend, President @realDonaldTrump took strong steps in putting the American people FIRST by signing four Executive actions that will give even more historic relief to the Great people of this Nation.
The United States will continue to stand with Jimmy Lai and all the freedom loving people of Hong Kong. #FreeJimmyLai
The arrest of @JimmyLaiApple in Hong Kong is deeply offensive &amp; an affront to freedom loving people around the world.

Dem Governors around America, using the excuse of the Coronavirus pandemic, are talking about mailing ballots to their entire state with no safeguard for the integrity of the process. The principle of one person, one vote is at the center of our Democracy &amp; we must defend it. https://t.co/b1ekYheziE
Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left.

Now more than ever, pro-life Americans need to let our voice be heard, to stand for life, in cities, states, and places of worship all across this country.
Joe Biden abandoned his historic support for the Hyde Amendment, has pledged to use taxpayer dollars to fund abortions at home and abroad, would fund Planned Parenthood at an unprecedented level and supports late term abortion.

Governor Cuomo has said repeatedly that President @realDonaldTrump's leadership in the pandemic was "phenomenal" as we surged testing, surged PPE, sailed in a hospital ship, built hospitals in New York. I couldn't be more proud of the support that we rendered to the people of NY.
Our hearts grieve for the fact that 1 in 5 of all the American lives lost in the Coronavirus pandemic were lost in the state of New York and some of that was because of poor decisions by the state and by Governor Cuomo. https://t.co/xl09WEouZc
The President made it clear, we're headed to the courts. The one person, one vote right is at the very center of our democracy &amp; we're not going to stand idly by while Dem states &amp; Dem Governors use the backdrop of the Coronavirus to send millions of ballots across this Country. https://t.co/fxWC2BTQzW

The Coronavirus Task Force met today after a big week for America! Thanks to President @realDonaldTrump's leadership, the first Phase-3 vaccine clinical trial started in record time &amp; we're continuing to surge testing across the Nation. We'll get through this, together!
President @realDonaldTrump put American workers FIRST and the economy boomed! Pennsylvania employed a record number of workers, gained back nearly 20,000 manufacturing jobs, saw median household income rise $1,400, and had 300 Opportunity Zones established!
Guy and Guy Chemical exemplify what this Great American Comeback is all about! His story shows us that at the end of the day, this isn't just about facts and figures, but people, families, and the dignity that comes with hard work. https://t.co/zt4dyCjLRL
In our first three years, President @realDonaldTrump kept every promise he made to the people of Pennsylvania and the results were extraordinary! We cut taxes, rolled back regulations, fought for free and fair trade, and added millions of jobs across the Nation!
Companies like Guy Chemical represent the very best of America: hard work, sacrifice, and love of neighbor. It was a privilege to be with @RepJohnJoyce, Deputy Secretary Karen Kelly, Guy Berkebile and everyone at Guy Chemical today where the Great American Comeback is underway! https://t.co/sniWAH8L05
We cut through red tape making it possible for patients with life-threatening infections from Coronavirus to receive plasma. Thanks to President @realDonaldTrump's leadership, America is leading in the rapid development of safe &amp; effective treatments for Coronavirus.
There are over 1500 locations across America where you can donate plasma. We are urging all Americans who have recovered from the Coronavirus to go DONATE TODAY! https://t.co/45sD5LLTyP
Today, President @realDonaldTrump launched a $27 million dollar National Awareness campaign to encourage Americans recovered from the Coronavirus to donate plasma. We're in this together and we will get through as Nation!
Thank you, Pennsylvania! Honored to be with Sheriff James Albert, Chief Bob Stafford and the Greensburg Police Department! I am proud to stand with our men and women of law enforcement! #CopsForTrump https://t.co/nVpPnzmZFG
I couldn't be more honored to be joined today by an extraordinary American, an Army Ranger, a decorated combat veteran, and the next congressman from #PA17, @SeanParnellUSA! VOTE Sean Parnell for Congress! https://t.co/ShU6tZMsL2
While Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to coddle the radical left from our Nation's Capital to Portland to cities across the Country, President @realDonaldTrump is taking action to restore law and order! https://t.co/vV4dp9JSyZ
Let me be clear: Federal law enforcement are not leaving Portland until the federal courthouse is secure and law-abiding citizens in Portland are safe. That's what leadership looks like. That's the leadership of President @realDonaldTrump.
In the wake of the violence on the streets of Portland, President @realDonaldTrump sent in federal law enforcement to protect the federal courthouse, and made it clear that the Governor and the Mayor of Portland needed to do their job or we would do it for them.
Where President @realDonaldTrump supported law enforcement from day one, Joe Biden &amp; the radical left say we have to choose between supporting our police or supporting all families of our communities. We can do both, we've done both &amp; we will keep doing both for four more years! https://t.co/m3hOcOrYLc
Our prayers are with his wife Gloria, his family and all those who loved and admired this good and great American. God Bless Herman Cain.
Karen and I were saddened to hear of the passing of our friend Herman Cain and we send our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. Herman was a success in business, an indispensable voice for the Conservative movement and he will be deeply missed.
When Democrats call for defunding the police, remember what's at stake: law and order, safety, and the peace of mind that you and your family have every right to enjoy as citizens of the greatest Nation on earth. We're not going to defund the police, not now, not EVER. https://t.co/wxnolDQMNO
Grateful for all of the law enforcement officers who support us and help get us safely to where we are going each day. Thank you for all you do!

We're not going to "build America back better" with more government, higher taxes, more regulation, more liberal policies. We're going to build America back better, stronger and more prosperous by doing again what President @realDonaldTrump and I did in our first 3 years. https://t.co/EEdedmMgW2

We will DEFEND the police. https://t.co/96S1rRmHI8
While Joe Biden supports taxpayer funding of abortion, our Administration has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life since day one. We will always fight to protect the precious lives of the unborn.
President @realDonaldTrump has stood strong for educational choice because we believe you shouldn't be denied the ability to choose your kids school based on income or zip code. The American people deserve to know: Joe Biden wants to end school choice.
Contrary to Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders' radical agenda, President @realDonaldTrump is rebuilding this economy based on freedom, free markets, and the rule of law. Their agenda is based on government control and our agenda is based on FREEDOM. https://t.co/lT7Y0bzQ3e
From the very first day of this Administration, President @realDonaldTrump set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden would set America on the path of Socialism and Decline.

Joe Biden's left wing policy agenda looks more and more like Bernie won. Our Country can't afford to have a leader who puts radical climate change plans like the Green New Deal ahead of American jobs. America needs four more years of President @realDonaldTrump. #MAGA
Through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, President @realDonaldTrump delivered real results for the American people. Joe Biden wants to reverse those historic tax cuts and carry out a plan that would devastate our Nation. We need #FOURMOREYEARS of President @realDonaldTrump!
While President @realDonaldTrump cut taxes and created more opportunity for all Americans, Joe Biden's tax plan that would shrink the US economy by 1.5% and cost our Nation 585,000 jobs. The American people deserve a President who fights for them! #FOURMOREYEARS #MAGA
It's #TaxDay in America and the choice couldn't be clearer! While President @realDonaldTrump passed the largest tax cut in American history, putting more money in the pockets of hard working Americans, Joe Biden has plans to raise taxes by $4 trillion &amp; stifle our economy.

On today's call with America's Governors, the @WhiteHouse Coronavirus Task Force ensured states that as some areas see cases rise, we will make sure they have what they need when they need it.
It is unconscionable that Democrats actually want to defund the police. President @realDonaldTrump and this Administration will ALWAYS stand with the brave men and women on the thin blue line.

President @realDonaldTrump &amp; this Administration are listening, learning &amp; leading. Yesterday, Joe Biden referred to the police at "the enemy" &amp; called for them to be defunded. We want all officers to hear us loud &amp; clear: we are NOT going to defund the police—not now, not ever.
On behalf of President @realDonaldTrump &amp; our entire Administration, know this: We have your back. We support you. We love you. We Back the Blue.

While President @realDonaldTrump cut taxes, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by nearly $4 trillion &amp; while President Trump signed more legislation to cut red tape than any other President, Joe Biden is already making plans to expand the Democrats government take over.
Today, after criticizing the Paycheck Protection Program that saved thousands of American businesses, Joe Biden is in Pennsylvania to talk about his plans for economy going forward at a company that received a PPP loan.
The choice has never been clearer for the American people. Under the Obama-Biden Administration, this economy lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs, but in the first three years of our Administration, we added 500,000 manufacturing jobs.
Right here Pennsylvania, 78% of small businesses are open and as evidence of the hard work of the people of this state, in the month of May the Keystone State added 200,000 net jobs. https://t.co/u61edji7TN
President @realDonaldTrump cut taxes, rolled back regulation, unleashed American energy, ended the war on coal and fought for free, fair and reciprocal trade. Under this President, America is winning again! 🇺🇸

President @realDonaldTrump's action in suspending all travel from China at the end of January bought our Nation valuable time to reinvent testing, spin up hundreds of millions of PPE and supplies, and begin the process of pursuing medicines, therapeutics, and vaccines.
The WHO let the world down by not informing the wider world of this pandemic as it began in China. It's no surprise that Joe Biden wants to keep up roped into another international organization after he even condemned the President's action in suspending all travel from China. https://t.co/RCi3BbG7QE
President @realDonaldTrump has made it clear, as we Open Up America Again we need to Open Up America's Schools. https://t.co/PvYmPcHtoG
