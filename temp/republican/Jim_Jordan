Not sure what's more ridiculous:\n\n-Defunding the police \n\nor \n\n-Invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President from office 26 days before the election. \n\nThe Democrats have lost their minds.

This President has shared private moments like this with families of soldiers, victims of violent crime, and people who've had businesses destroyed by the mob and natural disasters. \n\nThat's the President I know.
I walked through the door, and said "Todd, the President wants to talk to you." \n\nFor the next five minutes, family and friends sat in complete silence, as the President of the United States took time to talk to a dad who was hurting.
I then said, "Mr. President, I'm actually walking into their house right now. Obviously, they don't know I'm talking to you. But if you'd be willing to say hello to Eli's dad, you'd make a terrible day a little less terrible." \n\n"What's his name?" The President asked.
We talked about a few issues. And then he asked how the family was doing. \n\nI said they're doing "ok, but it's tough."  \n\nThe President said "Yea. Losing a loved one's always difficult, and it's really tough when they're so young."
It was a Saturday morning, three days after the accident. I was walking to the car, to go to Eli's parent's home, when the President called.
Two years ago, our nephew Eli was killed in a car accident. He lived a mile from us. Grew up wrestling and training with our boys. Was a high school state champion. Varsity athlete for Wisconsin.
President Trump truly cares about the American people. \n\nOur family's seen it.
