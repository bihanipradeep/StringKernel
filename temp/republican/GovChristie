I am happy to let you know that this morning I was released from Morristown Medical Center. I want to thank the extraordinary doctors &amp; nurses who cared for me for the last week. Thanks to my family &amp; friends for their prayers. I will have more to say about all of this next week.
I am thankful for our hardworking medical professionals and look forward to coming home soon.
In consultation with my doctors, I checked myself into Morristown Medical Center this afternoon. While I am feeling good and only have mild symptoms, due to my history of asthma we decided this is an important precautionary measure.
I just received word that I am positive for COVID-19. I want to thank all of my friends and colleagues who have reached out to ask how I was feeling in the last day or two. I will be receiving medical attention today and will keep the necessary folks apprised of my condition.
I want to thank all who have called and texted in the last few hours to check on my health. I feel fine and have no symptoms. I was last tested for COVID on Tuesday (it was neg) and was tested this morning. No results until tomorrow. I will let you know the results from here.
Getting ready to go on @GMA at 7:15 with @GStephanopoulos to discuss the diagnosis of @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS
Ready to go on ABC with pre-debate coverage. Let's watch together!
The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is truly a tragic loss for her family, the Court and our country. She led an extraordinary life. I had the honor of meeting her and I came to learn that she had a fabulous sense of humor! RIP Justice Ginsburg, you served our country well.
An outstanding dissent by 3rd Circuit Judge Paul Matey. I was proud to have him as my Deputy Chief Counsel! Opposite rulings from the Ninth Circuit and the Third Circuit on gun law show the Roberts Supreme Court can't duck the Second Amendment forever. https://t.co/ZpeYkEsWlA

Losing Tom Seaver tonight is a very sad. I was seven years old in 1969 and Tom Seaver made me a Mets fan. He was the best &amp; most complete pitcher of the last 50 years. He was my hero. My idol is gone &amp; so is a piece of my childhood. RIP Tom Terrific.https://t.co/6CRLO4z6mw

My condolences to the entire Philbin family on the passing of a really good person and American. https://t.co/Qo9cYqGfBz
Our Governor taking the side of big business and powerful unions over Main St small business. Now NJ has the second highest unemployment in America! Christie says Murphy's decisions favored big business (over small) and public workers over everything else https://t.co/jEKgW4v02p
As US Attorney I had the joy to work w/Judge Esther Salas when she was a member of the Federal Public Defender's Office. She's a great Judge and an extraordinary person. Mary Pat &amp; I pray for her, her husband Mark and their dear son Daniel. What an unspeakable tragedy and loss.
@D_Jay11 The Godfather or The Godfather Part II. No brainer
The loss of John Lewis represents the passing of not only a political leader but a moral leader. He tried every day to lead by example—not just words, real actions. We obviously didn't often agree politically but that doesn't matter today. He will be missed by me and this nation.
Opioid deaths are up 20% in NJ since the lockdown. Are those lives worth saving? The savings of small businesses are being wiped out. Is that worth saving? NJ unemployment is 2nd highest is the US. And, btw, NJ has 5 times the number of deaths than Georgia https://t.co/I9nwrk0d8x
This is just another example of why Mary Pat and I started https://t.co/JaRqDGMOG5 to help small businesses like this one. State policies are killing these businesses and they may never come back. What will NJ look like then? https://t.co/YQNXnSxLjv
Was very interesting talking to Steve Clemons about the COVID-19 crisis, our NJ30 Day Fund to help small businesses, the 2020 election and the political future of the Republican Party. Hope you will give it a watch! https://t.co/vOrFGVDhF1

The facts in Camden  matter: murders down 81%. Citizen complaints on excessive use of force by police down 95%. We made changes in 2013 NOT to break the union or to deal w/ a fiscal crisis. The story says we spent the SAME amount on policing as before. https://t.co/bSuQFMvms6
Please join us today on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos to discuss all the events of the week and the state of the 2020 race.
So proud of what we accomplished us a bi-partisan way on crime, education and economic development. We cannot let old school thoughts turn the clock back. Pleas watch this video—it is a blueprint for dealing with many of today's issues. https://t.co/XHK4khYXu8

Happy 4th of July to everyone today and happy birthday to the greatest country in the world and still the best hope and greatest force for freedom and liberty on the face of the earth. God Bless America!
Second big jobs report in a row.\n \n4.8 MILLION jobs created in June, blowing past expectations by 2 million. Great news for all the Americans who got back to work.
