It is in the U.S. national security interest to make sure that Afghanistan never again becomes a launching pad for terrorist actions against the U.S. homeland or our allies.\n \nPeace in Afghanistan is possible only when the Taliban honor their commitments.
Very pleased to see the U.S. military came to the aid of Afghan security forces being attacked by the Taliban.\n\nTaliban are not negotiating in good faith.\n\nhttps://t.co/ECJZoB0OIM

As a member of the Greatest Generation, Roberta did everything in her power to serve our nation in times of peace and conflict.  \n \nBeautiful, combative, and highly intelligent.  \n\nThat was the essence of Roberta McCain.
Roberta McCain accepted hardship with grace and brought tremendous joy to her family and friends.\n \nThrough countless bus rides, sitting by her side at rallies, and presidential debates I got to know Roberta McCain.  \n\nI am better for it.
To the McCain family:  You are in my prayers.  \n \nLet us celebrate a well-lived life, that of Roberta McCain.  \n \nShe was one of the most confident, interesting, funny, and squared-away people I have ever known.  \n\nhttps://t.co/Q6LGHmfrQu

We are all one car wreck away from needing help.  I know what that feels like first-hand.  Under my health care plan, I'll protect those with pre-existing conditions, and bring control back and money back to South Carolina. https://t.co/7p4uWQ6Mql
I love South Carolina. It is my home. It is the best place in the world to raise a family and run a business. As long as I am your senator, I'll keep it that way.
Obamacare is a disaster - I know because I was on it.  My premiums went up 300% and my coverage stunk.  Under my plan, SC would get almost $1 billion in new funding, pre-existing condition coverage will be protected, and localities will be in charge, not a faceless DC bureaucrat.
My friend @SenatorTimScott had a great police reform package, and @SenSchumer shut it down. @HarrisonJaime sided with Schumer over Tim Scott, and he will every time.
Want to know what's at stake this election?  If we lose the Senate, socialist Bernie Sanders will become Budget Committee Chairman.  If we hold the Senate, and I am re-elected, I will be Budget Committee Chairman.
South Carolinians do not appreciate Harrison putting himself above others.  \n\nIf Mr. Harrison is not able to interact with South Carolinians on the same terms they live their lives, he should not be their senator.
Are South Carolina workers demanding all their coworkers and customers be tested before going to work? \n\nDo restaurants demand their staff &amp; customers be tested before opening?
Mr. Harrison is demanding special treatment.\n\nOther than Mr. Harrison, is any other South Carolinian demanding every person they come in contact with be tested before they meet?
Appears @harrisonjaime is skipping tonights debate.  \n\nMr. Harrision is ducking the debate because the more we know about his radical policies, the less likely he is to win. It's not about medicine, its politics.\n\nHis liberal views are a loser in South Carolina - and he knows it!

After being informed of his positive test, and out of an abundance of caution, I was tested for COVID-19 in South Carolina.  \n\nI was informed I was negative.
Like millions of Americans, I'm wishing @realDonaldTrump  and @FLOTUS well regarding their COVID-19 infections. @SenMikeLee informed me today that he expects to be back at the @senjudiciary, fully engaged, by Oct. 12. I talked to Mike today - he's in good spirits and on the mend.
Talked to Senator Lee earlier today and wished him a speedy recovery. \n\nLook forward to welcoming him back to the @senjudiciary to proceed with the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barret on October 12. https://t.co/OVm0OQbnQF

Democrats chose to set in motion rules changes to stack the court at the Circuit level and they chose to try to destroy Brett Kavanaugh's life to keep the Supreme Court seat open.\n \nYou reap what you sow.
Being lectured by Democrats about how to handle judicial nominations is like an arsonist advising the Fire Department.
Great for more competition in the social media space. \n\nWell done, Mr. President.
Great decision by President Trump to approve the sale of TikTok to Oracle and Walmart. \n\nGreat for American consumers who are being protected from the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nhttps://t.co/niFMHjLb1f
I stand by what I said in Jan. 2019: Harry Reid &amp; Chuck Schumer changed Senate rules to try and stack the courts for Obama. Now it's coming back to haunt them as I predicted.

Jaime Harrison will be a loyal foot soldier in the cause of the radical liberals to destroy America as we know it.\n\nAs to me – I will be part of the Resistance and oppose their radical liberal agenda as they try to fundamentally change America.\n\n#5
I know Jaime Harrison -- who opposed the Kavanaugh nomination and joined the mob in the destruction of this fine man -- will oppose ANY Trump nominee.  \n\nI hope the people of South Carolina know that as well. \n\n#4
In light of these two events, I will support President @realDonaldTrump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg. \n\n#3
*  Harry Reid changed the rules to allow a simple majority vote for Circuit Court nominees dealing out the minority.\n\n* Chuck Schumer and his friends in the liberal media conspired to destroy the life of Brett Kavanaugh and hold that Supreme Court seat open.\n\n#2
The two biggest changes regarding the Senate and judicial confirmations that have occurred in the last decade have come from Democrats.\n\n#1

@JoeBiden Apparently, Joe Biden is listening and appears to have learned from the mistakes he and President Obama made in Iraq when the ordered a full and complete withdrawal.
@JoeBiden The US intelligence community and US military are strongly encouraging and supporting a small counter-terrorism force remaining in Afghanistan.
It's good to see former VP @JoeBiden is embracing a residual counter terrorism force in #Afghanistan as an insurance policy against the re-emergence of ISIS and al-Qaeda, both of whom still desire to attack American interests and kill Americans.  \n\nhttps://t.co/f8m2XGJcss

I urge the @FEC and others to investigate this situation. Is money being laundered through @ActBlue from straw donors or foreign governments to Democratic candidates, or is this legit? Somebody needs to find out ASAP.
Compared to @WINRED, only 4% of conservative donors were listed as unemployed. I don't believe Democrats are 12 times more likely to be unemployed than Republicans.

I strongly believe that my criticism of these trials is widely shared by members of the Senate in both parties.  \n\nTwo years later, we still don't have Mr. Khashoggi's remains or any sort of justice.
More is unknown about these trials than is known.  \n\nThese actions give sham trials a bad name.\n\nThis gruesome episode is not exactly the change one was hoping for when it comes to Saudi Arabia's behavior.

The residual US force, combined with Iraqi security forces and other partner nations, should be sufficient to prevent reemergence of ISIS and provide continued stability for Iraq -- both of which are in our national security interests.
The physical ISIS Caliphate has been destroyed and the Iraqi security forces are becoming more capable.   \n\nHowever, there remains a large number of ISIS-aligned fighters in Iraq and Syria who have the capability to reemerge en masse.
Due to conditions on the ground I support President @realDonaldTrump's decision to draw down to 3,000 American troops in Iraq. \n\nhttps://t.co/rriV16Ch3X
@realDonaldTrump The decision by President Trump to include South Carolina meets the desires of our coastal communities and state's leadership.  \n\nI very much appreciate President Trump for listening to our state and delivering for our people.
@realDonaldTrump After receiving positive feedback from Governor McMaster and state leaders, I led an effort to ensure President Trump included South Carolina in the announcement.
@realDonaldTrump When I first learned that there would be an extension of the ban on drilling off the Florida coast, I contacted South Carolina officials to gauge their interest.
@realDonaldTrump This issue has been a long time coming and I have worked extensively with President Trump about this issue as it relates to South Carolina.
Great news for South Carolina! \n\nI am very pleased President @realDonaldTrump listened to the desires of South Carolina and included our state in the extension of the current moratorium on offshore drilling.\n\nhttps://t.co/ekLz7y4GXm

When it comes to law and order and violence on our streets President @realDonaldTrump has been consistent on this issue from the start.
Biden is reluctantly emerging from his basement to confront this issue because Americans -- and what they see taking place on the streets of our nation -- are afraid to come out of theirs.
Violence in our communities was never mentioned at the #DemConvention because Democrats simply did NOT want to go there.  \n\nYesterday, Joe Biden was forced to talk about violence in the streets because the American people are FORCING him to go there.  \n\nhttps://t.co/c4dHiQEYzM

The old adage 'Live by the sword, die by the sword' will eventually come into play for Vladmir Putin.
How does this eventually end?  \n\nThe Russian people will reach a tipping point where they tire of Putin and his cronies plundering the nation and sowing discord throughout the world -- all at the expense of the average Russian.
To all those standing up for freedom and decency in Putin's Russia, you have my admiration and total support.
It goes without saying that you oppose Putin at your own peril and people like Mr. Navalny are on the right side of history.  \n\nAs always, the price for standing up for freedom comes at a heavy cost.
Very sad situation involving Alexei Navalny, one of the leading opposition figures in Russia against Vladmir Putin's regime.  \n \nhttps://t.co/rtt8ZgepVX
What you saw last night from President Obama was a downward spiral – from "Hope" to "Hate."\n \nI hope the American people will look at the results of President @realDonaldTrump on their behalf and not listen to the hateful rhetoric of his predecessor.
Ask the Arabs and Israelis who was more dangerous: \n\nPresident Obama: Who signed the Iran nuclear deal. \n\nOR\n\nPresident Trump: Who helped negotiate a peace agreement between Israel and UAE.
As to former Secretary @HillaryClinton:  \n\nWhy don't you ask the victims of ISIS -- the Yazidi women, the residents of Mosul, the Kurds -- who was more dangerous: Obama or Trump? \n\nhttps://t.co/qlgKNbZpAd
The Obama Years:  \n\n➡️ Pathetically weak foreign policy (ISIS, Iran nuclear deal).\n➡️ Slow-growth, weak economy.\n➡️ A rogue Department of Justice.  \n\nI welcome a comparison between the accomplishments of President Trump and President Obama on multiple levels.
Barack Obama may have taken his job seriously, but the results of his 8 years as President is why we have @realDonaldTrump.\n\nhttps://t.co/qlgKNbHOIF
President @BarackObama and Secretary @HillaryClinton give sore losers a bad name.  \n\nhttps://t.co/qlgKNbHOIF

Tonight, Jill Biden did a very good job representing herself and Joe in the causes they believe in.  \n\nShe's an outstanding person who has led a consequential life.
Putting AOC in the corner at the #DemocraticConvention will not hide the fact that she's the co-pilot, along with other liberals, driving the agenda.
It's painfully obvious The Squad with @AOC,  @BernieSanders, and Elizabeth Warren are in control of the Democratic Party's legislative agenda.  \n\nJoe Biden is merely along for the ride.
I would urge the Department of Justice to actively pursue prosecution of the perpetrators of this horrific attack."
They taunted and tortured this individual before severely injuring him. \n\nThe group responsible are great candidates for federal prosecution for violation of the Constitutional rights of the victim.
So much for ‘peaceful protests' in Portland. \n\nThis shocking attack by a mob against a young man in the streets of Portland is beyond the pale.\n \nhttps://t.co/jRQxhttKny
It is because of their courage that we can celebrate 100 years of women's contributions to our democracy.  \n\nThey changed the course of American history for the better.
The United States made a great choice with passage of the 19thAmendment.  \n\nToday we celebrate those who fought for and brought about this great accomplishment.
The biggest problem facing the Middle East and other parts of the world is the fact that women's voices are shut out.  \n\nOver time, the dismissal of women's voices hardens society.
We celebrate today the 100th anniversary of the #19thAmendment to the Constitution giving women the right to vote. \n\nThis is a great milestone in American history, which has enriched the American body politic.
President Trump has appointed conservative judges, rebuilt the military, destroyed ISIS, cut taxes and regulations, is securing the border, negotiated new trade deals, passed criminal justice reform, re-set the Middle East, is standing up to China, etc...
It is what it is. Without @BarackObama there would be no @realDonaldTrump.
I remember a slow-growth economy, a weakened military, ISIS raging, Iran emboldened, China eating our lunch, businesses struggling, and out-of-control illegal immigration.  Those are not the good old days to go back to.
My view of what life was like after the Obama presidency is much different than that of @MichelleObama...
Speaking of normal.....\n\nIf @BernieSanders socialist economic policies, pacifist foreign policy, and weakness on law and order becomes normal - God help us all.
I'm sure I've left out many other things….but not a bad first term. \n\nUnlike John Kasich I believe we are on the right path with President Trump. The Biden-Harris path leads to socialism at home and weakness abroad.\n\nApparently, John Kasich doesn't understand that.
▶️ Negotiated peace agreement between UAE and Israel.\n\n▶️ Stood up to China.\n\n▶️ Stopped caravans from Central America.\n\n▶️ Gotten Mexico to cooperate on illegal immigration unlike any other time in history.
▶️Rebuilt our military.\n\n▶️ Withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n▶️ Replaced NAFTA with USMCA.\n\n▶️ Placed travel ban on China at the start of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n▶️ Recognized Jerusalem as capital of Israel.\n\n▶️ Destroyed the ISIS Caliphate.
In Case You Missed It @JohnKasich \n\nPresident @realdonaldTrump has:\n\n▶️ Appointed and the Senate has confirmed over 200 conservative judges.\n\n▶️ 2 Supreme Court Justices.\n\n▶️ Cut Taxes.\n\n▶️Provided massive deregulation.\n\n▶️Brought the US to energy independence.
To those who suggest a pardon of Edward Snowden for his treasonous acts, you are doing a great disservice to those who suffered from his betrayal of his nation.
I'm confident President Trump understands the crimes committed by Snowden resulted in American forces – and those who assisted us throughout the world – being placed in greater danger. \n \nSpecifically, information released by  Snowden jeopardized operations in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan.
I hope Edward Snowden enjoys the money he is making in Russia and if he ever does step foot in the United States again, he should immediately be tried for his crimes against our country. \n\nhttps://t.co/EVIgEbhHJr

Iran is still the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.  \n\nAs the Iranian military grows, it sets a collision course with Israel and others threatened by the Iranian regime.  \n\nA stupid decision by the UN.

Great opportunity for the freedom loving world to make a difference.
As facts continue to pour in it is increasingly clear tremendous human rights violations against protesters in Belarus have already occurred.  \n\nI will be working with both GOP and Dems to explore additional ways to hold the Belarus government accountable for the rigged election.
I encourage President Trump, the European Union, and other freedom loving nations to use sanctions authorities to hold the Lukashenko regime in Belarus accountable for violence against protesters and running a rigged election.
To the Trump administration, Congress, and world at large: \n\nBeware of ‘little green men' from Russia going into Belarus to stop protests against a rigged election. \n\nThe people of Belarus deserve better.
I urge all those who believe in freedom and democracy to stand with the people of Belarus who are demanding a better life.\n \nI look forward to working with the Trump administration to push back as firmly as possible against the Lukashenko-rigged election.
I stand with the people of #Belarus who are pushing back against a sham election of one of the most autocratic and corrupt regimes on the planet.  \n\nhttps://t.co/iuf7L7UWho
@nytimes I very much appreciate Inspector General Horowitz, Attorney General Barr, U.S. Attorney Durham, and FBI Director Wray for trying to help right the ship by holding people accountable and restoring credibility to the DOJ and FBI.
@nytimes You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure this out.  \n\nJust look at their words and actions.
@nytimes * Today, an FBI lawyer will plead guilty to altering a document submitted to the FISA Court as part of the warrant process.\n\nThe question of why people did this is obvious to anyone who looks at the facts – which excludes most of the media.
@nytimes * The FBI and DOJ engaged in improper and illegal activity to obtain a warrant against an American citizen – Carter Page -- who was an adviser to the Trump campaign.  \n\n* The Inspector General and FISA Court rebuked the FBI/DOJ for their conduct in this matter.
To the liberal media including the @nytimes, you are missing the point. \n\nThis not a conspiracy theory.  \n\nThese are facts.  \n\n#CrossfireHurricane \n\nhttps://t.co/fojhFdCigR

@realDonaldTrump It will also hopefully set in motion the winding down of generational conflict between the Arab world and Israel.  \n\nI also want to thank Israeli Prime Minister @netanyahu and UAE Crown Prince @MohamedBinZayed for their hard work in pushing forward this agreement.
@realDonaldTrump Today's historic agreement between the State of Israel and the UAE is a sea change in Middle East politics and security alliances. \n\nIt was a breathtaking breakthrough which will help bring stability to a troubled region and enhance the economies of both Israel and the UAE.

Stand firm, Mr. President, in pushing for policies which continue to grow our economy and help those truly in need.
The federal government can help, but the feds should not bail out state and local governments for years – and in some cases decades – of poor decisions on their part.
Unfortunately, Democrats continue to insist on policies which slow down economic recovery as well as insist on bailing out local/state governments.
• helping local and state governments make the necessary preparations to safely reopening schools.
Republicans priorities in Phase IV should be:\n\n• continue strengthening our economic recovery.\n\n• moving the production of critical medical supplies from China back to the United States.\n\n• assistance to individuals who are still unemployed through no fault of their own.
Very disappointed the negotiations on a Phase IV package have stalled.  \n \nThe new unemployment numbers released earlier today show an economy which wants to come roaring back.

To my liberal friends: be careful what you wish for.\n \nA rehearing of the basic concept that judges are not prosecutors seems unwarranted and I fear our courts are becoming political tools rather than arbiters of the law.
The General Flynn case has gone from being a joke to scary. \n\nThe idea that federal judges would stop the government from dropping a case against a criminal defendant based on newly discovered evidence and abuse of power by the prosecution is stunning. \n\nhttps://t.co/x5OYar7klY

I appreciate the hard work of Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed. Big bipartisan win for our military.
This legislation will help our troops and their families with better pay and housing and will continue to modernize our military that's been under extreme stress since 9/11.
Very pleased that the Senate overwhelmingly passed the Defense Authorization bill in a strong bipartisan manner.
There is no substitute for having an on-ground component in high risk areas when it comes to protecting the American homeland against another attack from radical Islam.
When it comes to maintaining our gains against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, it is imperative that we keep a ground component working with SDF in Syria and Iraqi security forces to make sure ISIS does not come back again.
I also want to make it clear that I support renegotiating the cost of our American presence in South Korea, but I adamantly oppose reducing our forces at this time as it sends the worst possible signal to China.
However, I want to make it abundantly clear that while I support trying to reduce our footprint in Afghanistan, if we do not leave a residual counterterrorism force we will be paving the way for another 9/11.
As to the recent dust-up between certain House Republican elements and Liz Cheney, my view is that we should be as united as possible to take back the House.
The president has destroyed the ISIS Caliphate and taken China on in an unprecedented way.\n \nHowever, we cannot let our guard down because our enemies are still out there.\n \nIf you don't believe me, look at the intel assessments regarding Afghanistan.
President @realDonaldTrump has done more to stand up to the Chinese Communist Party than any president in my lifetime. I appreciate his leadership.
It is clear to me that China is using its diplomatic and student footprint in America to try to steal our nation blind when it comes to intellectual property, particularly in the area of vaccine development.
Great job by @SecPompeo shutting down the Chinese Communist Party's Houston consulate.

Trump Campaign Russia Collusion -- Strzok Notes Debunk New York Times Article | National Review https://t.co/cnP8ydnzDM
These comments by Mr. Strzok remind us why we should be very cautious and skeptical of any reporting by the @nytimes regarding the Trump presidency. https://t.co/PFit85BQ6k
These documents, which I have long sought, tell a damning story for anyone who's interested in trying to find the truth behind the corrupt nature of the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign in 2016 and beyond.
Moreover, the statements by Strzok raise troubling questions as to whether the FBI was impermissibly unmasking and analyzing intelligence gathered on U.S. persons.
The statements by Mr. Strzok question the entire premise of the FBI's investigation of the Trump Campaign and make it even more outrageous that the Mueller team continued this investigation for almost two and a half years.
Secondly, the comments of Peter Strzok regarding the February 14 New York Times article are devastating in that they are an admission that there was no reliable evidence that anyone from the Trump Campaign was working with Russian Intelligence Agencies in any form.
Those who knew or should have known of this development and continued to pursue a FISA warrant against Mr. Page anyway are in deep legal jeopardy in my view.
The dossier was a critical document to justify a FISA warrant against Mr. Page and this DOJ memo clearly indicates that the reliability of the dossier was completely destroyed after the interview with the primary sub-source in January 2017.
Most importantly after this interview of the sub-source and the subsequent memo detailing the contents of the interview, it was a miscarriage of justice for the FBI and the Department of Justice to continue to seek a FISA warrant against Carter Page in April and June of 2017.
It is clear to me that the memo regarding the FBI interview of the primary sub-source in January 2017 should have required the system to stop and reevaluate the case against Mr. Page. \n\nhttps://t.co/Hw50MzLnMV
A big congratulations and thank you to the Town of Pendleton's Police Chief Doyle Burdette who is retiring today after 25 years of service. https://t.co/9qUy6OukBg
My parents died when I was young. I don't care much for material possessions, but I make one BIG exception. https://t.co/1jRm2sSFan
The reason crime is spiking in these cities is because they've made a full scale assault to diminish Law &amp; Order.\n\nYou see what happens when you diminish the level of the police, begin to cut their budget, and hurt morale. \n\nIt's blowing up in their face.\n\nhttps://t.co/avqQCA1wgl
Speaking with @seanhannity in just a few minutes.\n\nTune in!
Glad to see President @realDonaldTrump talking about rebuilding America's infrastructure.  \n\nWhen it comes to infrastructure, Mr. President – Go Big, Be Bold!
My prayers are with Stan's family after his passing. \n\nSouth Carolina has lost a great one with the passing of Stan Spears.
I was saddened to learn that my good friend and our state's former Adjutant General Stan Spears died.\n \nGeneral Spears was a great military leader for the South Carolina National Guard. He made a real difference for our state and its security. \n\nhttps://t.co/0hLNKryayr
Congratulations to @RonnyJackson4TX on his win in #TX13.\n\nRonny is a strong conservative who will accomplish great things for our military and our country in Congress!
Unfortunately, it is not breaking news that the @nytimes is an intolerant media outlet.  \n\nIt should come as no surprise to anyone that Ms. Weiss's experiences with the @nytimes are real. \n\nI wish her well and believe her best days lie ahead.\n\nhttps://t.co/IMS53i7Hrr
Democrats have shown the lengths they will go to keep power. Boy, I hope they never get it. https://t.co/qD7vEa2TSS
It's imperative we defeat Doug Jones who has aligned himself with the liberal  Washington Democrats at every major turn over the people of Alabama.
I appreciate all the service Jeff Sessions has provided the people of Alabama and our nation.  I know Jeff has much more to contribute in the years to come. \n\nAs to the general election, we have a great candidate in Tommy Tuberville.
Congratulations to Coach @TTuberville for a decisive victory in the Alabama GOP Senate runoff.\n\nhttps://t.co/nQpoLVAfHV

To my Democratic colleagues: Why won't you condemn the radical calls to defund the police? https://t.co/XcXUiMVqXt
Golf is a great way for the President to get away from the confines of the White House and the pressures of the office.  \n\nKeep playing Mr. President. ⛳️🏌️‍♂️
President Trump claims he plays golf fast. Not only is that true, it is a tremendous understatement.\n\nI can also attest to the fact that a lot of business is done on the course. https://t.co/OSy2V5RunF
Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have previously requested Mr. Mueller appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify about his investigation.  \n\nThat request will be granted.
Apparently Mr. Mueller is willing - and also capable - of defending the Mueller investigation through an oped in the Washington Post.
Mary Jean touched so many lives by her kindness, optimism, humor, and tenacity for her causes.  We're gonna win this fall for all the Mary Jean's of the world. RIP my dear friend.
It was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of one of my dearest friends and greatest supporters, Mary Jean Baxley. It is with great joy that I know she is with the Lord, free of pain and worry.
Equally important: Over time we learn how biased and corrupt Crossfire Hurricane and the Mueller probes were.
In my view it would be justified if President @realDonaldTrump decided to commute Roger Stone's prison sentence.\n\nMr. Stone is in his 70s and this was a non-violent, first-time offense.\n\nhttps://t.co/jbbGTucRpq
@realDonaldTrump I hope Americans will rally to the company's side in letting everyone in the business world know it is more than OK to work with the President of the United States to make America stronger. #Goya
Very much appreciate Bob Unanue, who apparently committed the unpardonable sin of trying to help President @realDonaldTrump's Hispanic Prosperity Initiative move our economy forward. \n \nhttps://t.co/zGpasjbiUN
Regarding Mark Kelly's business ties to China:  If the shoe were on the other foot, the mainstream media would be going wild.\n \nChina sends America the virus, all the while Mark Kelly gets checks.  Follow the yuan!\nhttps://t.co/sdRjAYHgX2
Great job by @SecPompeo applying global Magnitsky Act sanctions against Chinese bad actors.  This is a giant step forward.\n \nSec Pompeo has put China on notice – their flagrant violations of international law and norms comes with a price.  Well done.  \n \nhttps://t.co/TqBYTc1nwR
Who is backing liberal Democrat Jaime Harrison?\n\n- Nancy Pelosi\n- Chuck Schumer\n- Hillary Clinton\n- Rosie O'Donnell\n- Barbara Streisand\n\nI must be doing something right if those people want to beat me! https://t.co/02ftP1E7Xy
🕘 📺 🕘 📺\n\nSpeaking with @seanhannity in just a few minutes about why the biggest losers from efforts to #DefundThePolice will be the poorest and most crime-ridden neighborhoods throughout the country.\n\nTune in!
If you want to see what life is like where there are no police, courts, or justice systems, spend some time in the Middle East.  \n\nA bad idea for America.
When the police are 'Defunded' the vacuum will be filled by the most dangerous and unsavory elements of society.  \n\nI support reforming the police, not ‘Defunding the Police.'
The biggest loser from any effort to ‘Defund the Police' will be the poorest and most crime-ridden neighborhoods throughout the country.  \n\nhttps://t.co/OtSVb3SS9m
Friends:\n \nIt's Senator Graham's birthday week! We're putting together a surprise, and we know seeing your birthday wishes will make this a special day for Senator Graham.

@kilmeade Graham also discussed NBA allowing players to display social justice messages on uniforms. \n\nGraham feels the NBA is free to make whatever decision they want but believes you will not find anybody sporting Free Hong Kong on their jersey because the NBA is in the tank for China.
Senator Graham spoke with @kilmeade about Trump's speech from Mount Rushmore, the left's continued push to defund police as crime soars across the nation, and Black Lives Matter being a left leaning political movement which hurts minority families. \n\nhttps://t.co/nD41iFYg8P

The 4th of July represents the birth of a new way of governing that is continually evolving and centers on the hope and power of individual citizens.  \n\nIt is very much something worth celebrating now and for years to come.
Contrary to Mr. Kaepernick's opinion, I believe the world is MUCH better off with America and all the contributions she has made since her founding.  \n\nhttps://t.co/tIdOg9EU44
Happy Birthday America! 🎂🎉\n\nThe greatest country on Earth and still the best hope for mankind!  \n\n🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸\n\n#July4th2020
In South Carolina, we know a thing or two about hard work, freedom, and individual liberty. Independence Day is a celebration of those ideas — and of the many Americans who sacrificed along the way to realize them. As you go about your day, take a moment to remember them! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/3aag0WqELu
Did you see the news? The economy added a record 4.8 MILLION jobs in June! America is coming back, people are ready to get to work, and confidence in reopening the country is growing stronger each and every day. https://t.co/gDqF9NeDAv
Senator @SteveDaines and I just watched this @SenSchumer video and have a few things to say about it... https://t.co/i7ypc5xqok https://t.co/V0wprfEsVp
Susan Rice is the one who went on five national TV shows, lied about the level of security at our Benghazi consulate and tried to blame the attack on videos coming out of Egypt.
Susan Rice accusing anyone of being derelict in their duties - especially when it comes to national security - is a bit rich.\n\nhttps://t.co/28FVWZrsUM
D.C. statehood goes against the wishes of the Founding Fathers, hurts South Carolina, and would empower the most radical agenda in modern American politics. https://t.co/rIDJEcqUoh
This is really good news.  \n\nIt means America is coming back economically, people are going back to work. \n\nThere is confidence you can actually open up the country.  \n\nBut coronavirus could be a wet blanket on a growing economy if we don't control it. \n\nhttps://t.co/NBI3qXCUXp

Finally, if we had adopted Senator Paul's mandatory withdrawal from Afghanistan within a year, it would put radical Islamists throughout the world on steroids. We must never forget it was Afghanistan where al Qaeda planned the 9/11 attacks on our nation.
I am pleased that members of the Senate are listening to the experts, our commanders and intel specialists, and not General Paul.
We have reduced our presence in Afghanistan by over 90% and it is imperative that we maintain our counterterrorism force as an insurance policy against another 9/11attack.
Senator Paul and President Obama seem to live in a world where sound military advice doesn't matter.\n \nThe intelligence assessments about a non-conditions based withdrawal from Afghanistan regarding our homeland security are devastating.
From a South Carolina point of view, this is NOT a good deal for us. \n\nThis would dilute South Carolina's say in the United States Senate and it would empower the most radical agenda in modern American politics. #DCStatehood\n\nhttps://t.co/DdSb3v6Gb7
