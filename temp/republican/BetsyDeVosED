Great to join North Carolina legislators, parents and students in Raleigh to hear about the state's tremendous work to expand #SchoolChoice. It's critical that all families in NC and across the U.S. have the opportunity to choose where, when and how their students learn. https://t.co/EnqWV6q2jg
So pleased to join @virginiafoxx today as we met with Jenkins ES students, parents and staff as @hickoryschools and all North Carolina public schools reopened for in-person learning. This is such an important option for families not only in NC but across the country. https://t.co/MxWZLYbZam

I couldn't agree more! https://t.co/3fehQuJQ2H
We didn't ask for this pandemic, but generally no challenge is invited—we meet this head on because we're parents. It's what we do. We parents love our children, and that love pushes fear aside. So, let's commit to do what's right for our children, &amp; all students, this fall. 6/6
Teachers, if you want to teach in-person, we support you. We've provided $13 billion for PPE, cleaning and training. If your health requires you to teach virtually, we support you. We have proposed more flexible and personalized funding for PD to improve teacher preparation. 5/6
If you want or need to send your child to school in-person, we support you. If virtual learning is best for your family, we support you. If you want to attend a school other than your government-assigned public school, we support you. 4/6
Many of you feel overwhelmed or powerless. Frustrated or confused. Anxious or eager for clarity. That's why President @realDonaldTrump and I are fighting for more options for students this fall. Every family needs to be able to do what's right for their child. 3/6

Education is an investment in individual students. Now, more than ever, they need freedom to find the right fit. With @SenatorTimScott's #SchoolChoiceNow bill, $7B in scholarships could help families w/ ed expenses like tutoring, tuition &amp; home-schooling: https://t.co/ovaksl3biW
Too many parents will be left in the lurch this fall by one-size-fits-all decisions made by their assigned district. @SenatorTimScott's #SchoolChoiceNow bill would provide $7B in scholarships to ensure kids can continue to learn in the ways &amp; places that work for their families. https://t.co/EdavBJZEQ9

"Their children are often in self-contained classrooms with just six students, and the parents believe there are ways to safely educate them offline, even if the entire student population isn't ready to go back."
"In the conversations about whether to reopen school buildings—or even how to shape virtual learning—parents of special education students fear that the unique needs of their children are not being urgently considered."
Ethan, a special ed student born w/ polymicrogyria has missed months of physical therapy and "has been angrier and more physically aggressive." His mother said that "if the computer isn't playing Sesame Street he slams the laptop down…It's been frustrating and a waste of time."
"And in Loudoun County, 8-year-old Theo Duran, who is autistic, struggles more to walk up the stairs or hold a crayon to write—all tasks he was making progress on before the coronavirus pandemic hit and shut down his school."
Some parents described virtual sessions as so ineffective that they just skipped them. Heinegg said for her son "It was extremely damaging to his self-esteem...I have spent years and lots of energy making sure he loves learning, and that was destroyed. How do you undo that?"
"Ayo Heinegg's son, a rising sixth-grader in the District with dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, is typically a high-performing student. But he struggled to keep up with his coursework on multiple online platforms and lost his confidence in the classroom."
Gibson said that "When school went virtual, it was hard to learn online—I had never done that before…I'm mad because I want to go to school. And I am hearing different days of when we go back to school. I miss my teachers, and I miss my friends."
Antwon Gibson's high school \"didn't even attempt to teach his ‘independent living' class virtually this spring. The gregarious 18-year-old has an intellectual disability and reads and performs math below grade level. He's been out of the classroom since schools closed in March…"
.@washingtonpost: "Parents across the country who have students w/ special ed needs say the stakes are high if schools do not reopen...children are not just falling behind academically...but missing developmental milestones &amp; losing key skills necessary for an independent life."
I've been called the \"School Choice Secretary\" by some. I think it's meant as an insult, but I wear it as a badge of honor. #COVID19 has laid bare there is no one-size-fits-all solution for education—it must be centered in what's best for students and families. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/T8xcfTNoXA
A majority of Americans support #SchoolChoice. Every family and child in America deserves the choice of where and how they pursue their education—regardless of income or zip code. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/qJO9oWCMWC
This is why @POTUS and I are fighting to put parents in charge of their children's education. Read the full article here: https://t.co/H1h21Rl5cJ
"We got a letter from the superintendent saying…more than 70% of parents surveyed…wanted...full in-person instruction or a hybrid model...the next paragraph says we're going full remote, which just struck me…as odd," said Doug Reed, a father of two.
A former High School teacher, Kathryn Rose said she understands why teachers are wary of returning to the classroom…but urged everyone to \"acknowledge and accept there are other bad outcomes without in-person instruction, like loss of learning and increased abuse and neglect\"
"@ChiPubSchools parent Nancy Curran said she's afraid her son Oliver…who is in a special ed program, will be ill-served by more remote learning if the city's schools don't reopen…she said online instruction is unrealistic &amp; frustrating for many students with special ed plans."
After learning District 65 is starting school w/ remote learning, Jessica Hockett decided to home-school her kids instead. "I had hoped they'd get the kids back in school at the start of the school year, even if it was some kind of hybrid choice.\"
Mairin Gradek's optimism that schools would reopen was buoyed by survey results: 75% of parents supported an in-person or hybrid plan. Remote learning trailed in 3rd place. But, recently, District 25 joined a list of school systems that have abandoned hopes of bringing kids back.
"Many parents say they feel like they're part of a silent majority, whose desire to have their children back in school has been pushed aside by school officials who are buckling to pressure from teachers unions." The @ChicagoTribune published several parent stories worth reading:
#SchoolChoice is about recognizing parents' inherent right to choose how and where their child is educated. This pandemic has made clear parents need that power now more than ever before. This administration will keep fighting until every family has #SchoolChoiceNow. https://t.co/HZdzxsV4po
Denisha is proof that #SchoolChoice works. Not only did it change the trajectory of her life, she's now an advocate who fights every day for students like her to have the same opportunity. Listen to her story in her own words. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/B0E6BgnxQw
President @realDonaldTrump and I trust parents. We believe in students. Each of them deserves the opportunity to go back to school this fall in the ways and places that will work best for them and their families. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/j6o3NbBW5d
The entire editorial is a MUST READ: https://t.co/4T4IdRGAsT 4/4
\"If there's a silver lining, it's...getting a closer look at the true...character of the unions. They are allies of the political left. And they wield monopoly power that they are using to coerce parents and taxpayers to dance to their agenda if they want children to learn.\" 3/4
The unions \"have a cynical interest in forcing their competitors to shut down. What a humiliation it would be if charter and private schools reopen and demonstrate that in-person education can be done...Or if parents...decide a private school would be better for their child.\" 2/4
.@WSJ editorial today: "Rather than work to open schools safely, the unions are issuing ultimatums and threatening strikes until they are granted their ideological wish list. Children, who would have to endure more lost instruction, are their hostages." 1/4
Walter explains why #SchoolChoice is "the great equalizer"—how it can not only break the cycle of poverty but truly change lives. This is why @SenatorTimScott's #SchoolChoiceNow Act is so important. ALL students deserve the same opportunity Walter had. https://t.co/cF9d89Hlbm

Tyreke has a bright future ahead of him! Through #SchoolChoice he was able to attend a school that met his unique learning needs and is thriving because of it. Finding the right fit for his education has given him the courage to pursue his dreams. https://t.co/an6KiFmi2O
I am so proud of Walter Blanks and the advocate he's become for students and #SchoolChoice. His work to make sure other kids have the same opportunities he did is truly inspiring. Thank you for all you do, Walter! #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/r1nv4aTJ2d
#SchoolChoice is life changing. I want to thank all the students, parents and educators who came out in Columbus today to share your stories. President @realDonaldTrump and I stand with you and with every child in America who needs #SchoolChoiceNow. https://t.co/P4hcHELo9v
Thank you @SenatorTimScott, @SenAlexander for your tireless support of students and of President @realDonaldTrump's plan to provide #SchoolChoiceNow to students across America. This bill must be part of any relief package to help all students return safely to school in the fall. https://t.co/nl57L2HE3G
#DCOSP has connected 10K+ low-income families to life-changing educational opportunities. Today, @usedgov announced $85M to further support its mission. @POTUS and I will continue to fight to grow this program and expand #EducationFreedom for all students: https://t.co/gKfCfnQq9B https://t.co/VT08EvT6qH
A call to action from a mother in SC who says social isolation is taking a toll on her son who is diagnosed with Down syndrome. "As adults, it is our responsibility to find safe ways to resume an interactive learning environment…and choice must be at the center." #ReOpenSchools https://t.co/B9eCmP48tR
In SC today with Governor @henrymcmaster who knows students need to be able to safely return to school this fall and parents need options to make that happen. Thanks to his leadership, $32M in #CARESAct funds will go to low-income SC families to find the right fit this fall. https://t.co/h9HhciFCbo
Great to be back on the road with @VP as we continue our work across the country to support local leaders as they safely reopen schools in the fall with a focus on doing what's right for students. https://t.co/IxU2AkuTEJ
Reading is foundational to lifelong learning! Thank you @SecretaryCarson for encouraging students to keep reading over the summer and for inviting me to read along with you! https://t.co/666oZyCQRZ
#FindSomethingNew is an innovative @WhiteHouse initiative to connect America's workers to skills-based education opportunities. Whether first entering the workforce or transitioning due to #COVID19, https://t.co/1sRHFhbae4 can connect you to multiple pathways to success.
Five pediatricians interviewed by @NBCNightlyNews agree the benefits of being in school "far outweigh" the risks of #COVID19 for students. All 5 plan to send their kids back to school in the fall. We can reopen schools safely &amp; ensure learning continues. https://t.co/bnRUB1S6vq
Safely reopening schools in the fall must remain our priority. It's the right thing to do for students. It's the right thing to do for families. And, it's the right thing to do for our future. \n\nWATCH: https://t.co/KPYaWC7vYz https://t.co/B8GsTHPGVf
Access to a great education is the launching pad to long-term success. Proud to join @POTUS as he signed this EO establishing the Hispanic Prosperity Initiative which will improve Hispanic Americans' access to educational options &amp; economic opportunities: https://t.co/dEG4rHwNAh
Pleased to host @VP and the @WhiteHouse Coronavirus Task Force at @usedgov today for continued conversation about the need to reopen America's schools. It is not a matter of IF but HOW. All students need to continue learning this fall. https://t.co/RyF4Zt3YOy
Families are demanding that their kids continue to learn this fall. Schools need to reopen and get creative about how to deliver a full school year of learning. Where there's a will, there's a way. Thanks, @TuckerCarlson, for giving a voice to parents who are demanding better. https://t.co/tOEYMdDzoF
"For those of us who are men of color...the effects of false accusations can have highly devastating effects." Joseph is one of many students I met with as we worked to correct the previous #TitleIX regime's failures. Our rule gets this right for everyone. https://t.co/J4NNuocSHs
Absolutely right, @POTUS! Learning must continue for all students. American education must be fully open and fully operational this fall! https://t.co/1tmyfKpj2o
This #IndependenceDay let us celebrate the extraordinary courage of our Founders and the exceptional idea that all Americans were endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Happy #FourthofJuly! https://t.co/vqRGw3TNCo
As we celebrate the 56th anniversary of the #CivilRightsAct, we reflect on the progress &amp; recognize there is still much to be done. Too many students are trapped in a system that fails them. We will not rest until EVERY student can learn in ways that unlock their full potential. https://t.co/ZORWdItToT
We've launched an exciting #RuralTechProject that we hope will spark more innovation for rural students, and all students. This is a challenge for educators to #RethinkSchool and to embrace technology to prepare students for well-paying, in-demand careers: https://t.co/GEK6irGrXq
