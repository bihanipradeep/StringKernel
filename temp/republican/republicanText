Totally Negative China Virus Reports. Hit it early and hard. Fake News is devastated. They are very bad (and sick!) people!
....protecting people with Pre-existing conditions. He has done nothing on Healthcare, cost or otherwise, or virtually anything else. An empty suit!!!
How dare failed Presidential Candidate (1% and falling!) @CoryBooker make false charges and statements about me in addressing Judge Barrett. Illegally, never even lived in Newark when he was Mayor. Guy is a total loser! I want better Healthcare for far less money, always.....

This is happening all over the U.S. Rigged Election??? https://t.co/MG0d9xUH1Z
STIMULUS! Go big or go home!!!
"The Radical Left is trying hard to undermine the Christopher Columbus legacy. A great Italian opened new chapter in history of humanity by discovering the Americas".  @OANN  Not on my watch!
Actually, Tony's pitching arm is far more accurate than his prognostications. "No problem, no masks". WHO no longer likes Lockdowns - just came out against. Trump was right. We saved 2,000,000 USA lives!!! https://t.co/YyLyCsbZ7a
We love the people of Lake Charles, Louisiana. You've been hit hard , and often, but your Federal Government is there to help. It will all work out, and FAST!!! @fema @USArmy
Republicans will be providing far better Healthcare than the Democrats, at a far lower cost...And will always protect people with Pre-existing conditions!!!!
GOP raises over 1 Billion Dollars through @WINRED since recent founding. November 3rd. The most important Election in the History of our Country!!!
California hired a pure Sleepy Joe Democrat firm to count and "harvest" votes. No way Republicans get a fair shake. Lawyers, get started!!! @GOPLeader  California is in big trouble. Vote Trump and watch the greatest comeback of them all!!! Also, New York and Illinois - go for it!
Congratulations Dan. You, Breitbart and others have decimated the business at Drudge. It's gone the way of the @NBA, ratings down 70%. People want the TRUTH! Drudge Report sold out, suffered a massive "nervous breakdown". Happening @FoxNews also??? https://t.co/Zr07XdHtNx

Wow. Our future V.P. So cool! https://t.co/l7lp69ZsYl
Mitt can't be thrilled about this! Joe also said yesterday he's running for the U.S. Senate (again) and totally forgot where he was (wrong State!). Joe has never been a nice or kind guy, so it's easier to find this obvious &amp; rapidly getting worse "dementia" unacceptable for USA! https://t.co/QIpH7RDfAV
....Much of the money we have spent is on our ground game, said to be the best ever put together. I'll let you know how good it is on November 3rd. Very expensive to do, but opportunity could be BIG! I will spend additional money if we are not spending enough!
I keep reading Fake News stories that my campaign is running low on money. Not true, &amp; if it were so, I would put up money myself. The fact is that we have much more money than we had 4 years ago, where we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary, and still easily won, 306-223!
Great Florida Rally tonight. Big crowd, lot of enthusiasm (you win races with enthusiasm). Just got back. Tomorrow night it's off to Pennsylvania and another BIG crowd. We are winning. Economy is starting to boom. Good timing!!!

I did more in 47 months than Biden did in 47 years. Now, he is pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee...\nhttps://t.co/ON0iRBfFS2
Biden refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. He says voters "don't deserve" to know. If they win, Dems will pack the #SCOTUS w/ radical left justices who will shred the #2A, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals &amp; terrorists. https://t.co/alVSZUDc73
Joe Biden's agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida Seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens—decimating Medicare and destroying Social Security...https://t.co/GgHP0NvpEe

Getting ready to land in Florida. BIG CROWD! Live on various networks: @OANN, @cspan, @newsmax and others!!!
.@FoxNews allows more negative ads on me than practically all of the other networks combined. Not like the old days, but we will win even bigger than 2016. Roger Ailes was the GREATEST!
"I'm running as a proud Democrat, for the Senate". Sleepy Joe Biden today. It's only going to get worse. It is not sustainable for our County - China will own us!!!!
Biden losing big in Florida. Only Fake Polls show otherwise! Bad for Healthcare. Thinks he's running for the Senate. Forgot Mitt Romney's name, and where he was!
Happy National Farmers Day! https://t.co/2Q8dbu5UyO
The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!
Republicans should be strongly focused on completing a wonderful stimulus package for the American People!
What's going on, almost nobody is showing up for Sleepy Joe rallies!
Sleepy Joe Biden had a particularly bad day today. He couldn't remember the name of Mitt Romney, said again he was running for the U.S. Senate, and forgot what State he was in. If I did any of this, it would be disqualifying. With him, he's just Sleepy Joe!
He should sue the women, and all of those who illegally worked with them, for false and disgusting accusations!!! https://t.co/ocdEeIFxeF

307,000 Veterans Died waiting for Healthcare at the V.A. During Sleepy Joe Biden's Watch. 800,000 Records Stalled! A complete and total disaster.
Heading to the Greatest Economy Of All Time!!!  VOTE
So Biden is coughing and hacking and playing "fingers" with his mask, all over the place, and the Fake News doesn't want to even think about discussing it. "Journalism" has reached the all time low in history. Sadly, Lamestream knows this and doesn't even care!
Almost nobody showed up to the Sleepy Joe Biden "Rally" in Ohio. The reporting and polls are a Media Con Job - Fake News. We have far more support and enthusiasm than even in 2016. November 3rd. will be a great day for America!!!  #MAGA
HAPPY COLUMBUS DAY TO ALL!
STOCK MARKET UP ANOTHER 300 POINTS - GREATEST LEADING INDICATOR OF THEM ALL!!! DON'T RUIN IT WITH SLEEPY JOE!!!
The Economy is about ready to go through the roof. Stock Market ready to break ALL-TIME RECORD. 401k's incredible. New Jobs Record. Remember all of this when you VOTE. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your Taxes. Depression!!! Don't let it happen! #MAGA
Republicans must state loudly and clearly that WE are going to provide much better Healthcare at a much lower cost. Get the word out! Will always protect pre-existing conditions!!!
https://t.co/599e8A6ogf
We will have Healthcare which is FAR BETTER than ObamaCare, at a FAR LOWER COST - BIG PREMIUM REDUCTION. PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL BE PROTECTED AT AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL THAN NOW. HIGHLY UNPOPULAR AND UNFAIR INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ALREADY TERMINATED. YOU'RE WELCOME!
So Crazy to watch Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut lecture all on morals &amp; ethics when for 25 years he said he was a Great War Hero in Vietnam, and he was never even there. He lied &amp; cheated right up until the day he got caught. Thank you to those in military who turned him in!
STOCK MARKET UP BIG!
Remember, I wouldn't be President now had Obama and Biden properly done their job. The fact is, they were TERRIBLE!!!
November 3rd. will be the most exciting day in U.S. Election History, even more so than 2016. Tremendous excitement and enthusiasm, like perhaps never seen before. Nobody showing up to Sleepy Joe Rallies. Places are DEAD. Stiff!!! See you in Florida tonight.
Stock Market Up Big. Do I get no credit for this? Never even mentioned by the Fake News. A New Record for Stocks and Jobs Growth. Remember, "it's the Economy Stupid".  VOTE!!!
Our Country cannot survive as a Socialist Nation, and that's what the Democrats want it to be. The USA will never become a large scale version of Venezuela. All control is already being taken away from Sleepy Joe. He has Zero to say!!!
The Republicans are giving the Democrats a great deal of time, which is not mandated, to make their self serving statements relative to our great new future Supreme Court Justice. Personally, I would pull back, approve, and go for STIMULUS for the people!!!
Remember, Stock Market at an All Time High, and going up. 401k's at RECORD. With Sleepy Joe comes Tax Increases, jobs losses and DEPRESSION like never seen before!!! VOTE!!!
SO MUCH FAKE NEWS! The Lamestream Media has gone absolutely insane because they realize we are winning BIG in all of the polls that matter. They write or show one false story after another. They are truly sick people. VOTE!!!
Save your 2nd Amendment. Vote Trump! https://t.co/3MU5xihohD
Illinois has no place to go. Sad, isn't it? Vote Trump!

The FBI and Law Enforcement must focus their energy on ANTIFA and the Radical Left, those who have spent the summer trying to burn down poorly run Democrat Cities throughout the USA!
Big spike in the China Plague in Europe and other places that the Fake News used to hold up as examples of places that are doing well, in order to make the U.S look bad. Be strong and vigilant, it will run its course. Vaccines and cures are coming fast!

Record 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. 53% Approval Rating Overall. Record 56% "Better Off Now" than 4 Years Ago (Gallup) during the Obama/Sleepy Joe Biden Administration, even as we round the turn on the China Plague. Thank you. Next year will be the BEST EVER!!!
It's the only way they know! https://t.co/zVBuie6FTk
"56% of registered voters tell Gallup that they are better off than they were 4 years ago (under Obama/Biden), while only 32% said they were worse off." Highest number on satisfaction yet recorded, by far. mgoodwin@nypost.com... And it will only get better!!! VOTE
See you in FLORIDA tomorrow night. Big Rally!!!
The Fake News, @CNN, MSDNC, the failing @nytimes, and the rest, are working overtime spewing every lie in the book to make sure they can demean and disparage, at the highest level possible, to try and win an election for a man who is totally unqualified to be your President, S.J.
They are indeed Dr. Fauci's own words. We have done a "phenomenal" job, according to certain governors. Many people agree...And now come the Vaccines &amp; Cures, long ahead of projections! https://t.co/ANqKL4eBqJ

Biden evades "Court Packing" question. @FoxNews  Because his puppet masters are willing to destroy the U.S. Supreme Court. Don't let this, and so many other really bad things, happen. VOTE!
People don't remember the chaos, hatred &amp; discord that we all went through during the 8 years of Obama/Biden. St. Louis, Oakland, Baltimore, and so many other places,  were a complete &amp; total disaster. I wouldn't be in the beautiful White House if it weren't for Sleepy Joe, etc.
A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday. That means I can't get it (immune), and can't give it. Very nice to know!!!
AP has long been Fake News! https://t.co/dmjxcS0tTK
In 2016, the ABC News/Washington Post Poll was such a complete disaster that these two Fake News Organizations changed the numbers prior to the Election. Now these haters are trying the same thing, though on a lesser scale, again. Will have a bigger win than even 2016!
.@NateSilver538  "The Trump 2016 Victory was the most shocking political development of my lifetime." That's only because you got it  so wrong. This time there is far more ENTHUSIASM even than 2016. Winning many States much more easily than people understand. BIG CROWDS!!!
FDR's own party told him you cannot PACK the United States Supreme Court, it would permanently destroy the Court. @judgejeanine @tedcruz But now the Radical Left Democrats are pushing Biden to do this. He has zero chance against them!

Joe Biden is a PUPPET of CASTRO-CHAVISTAS like Crazy Bernie, AOC and Castro-lover Karen Bass. Biden is supported by socialist Gustavo Petro, a major LOSER and former M-19 guerrilla leader. Biden is weak on socialism and will betray Colombia. I stand with you!

The Gallup Poll has just come out with the incredible finding that 56% of you say that you are better off today, during a pandemic, than you were four years ago (OBiden). Highest number on record! Pretty amazing!
...I do not tolerate ANY extreme violence. Defending ALL Americans, even those who oppose and attack me, is what I will always do as your President! Governor Whitmer—open up your state, open up your schools, and open up your churches!
...today that they foiled a dangerous plot against the Governor of Michigan. Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist—while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities...
Governor Whitmer of Michigan has done a terrible job. She locked down her state for everyone, except her husband's boating activities. The Federal Government provided tremendous help to the Great People of Michigan. My Justice Department and Federal Law Enforcement announced...
Biden is against Oil, Guns and Religion, a very bad combination to be fighting in the Great State of Texas. We are Winning Big, in the Real Polls, all over the Country!!! NOVEMBER 3rd. VOTE!!!

I've got news for the Democrats &amp; their friends in Hollywood: The dogma lives loudly in me, it lives loudly in you —and the right to live, work, and worship according to the dictates of our faith and our conscience lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States!
Joe Biden's running mate actually attacked another one of our judges just because he was a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus &amp; the Ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said Judge Barrett's Catholic Faith was "of concern" saying "The dogma lives loudly within you."

To @AdamLaxalt, Glen Levitt, Mike McDonald, @VoteJimMarchant, @DanRodimer, and my fellow Americans from near and far: it was great to be back in the Silver State with @KarenPence! https://t.co/8Z2Dzvz9gR
Joe Biden supported NAFTA &amp; out in the Heartland, we saw the impact of that trade deal. Joe Biden never lifted a finger to reform it or to renegotiate it. But thanks to the man who wrote "The Art of the Deal," Americans got a better deal: NAFTA is gone, the USMCA is here to stay! https://t.co/uhLIXc5OW7
In 26 days we're going to win a great victory for Nevada and America when we re-elect President @realDonaldTrump for four more years! 🇺🇸 https://t.co/WI7skHj2Ub

Welcome Home Mr. President! 🇺🇸 https://t.co/8tZd3aRvXD
We're also grateful for the concern, support &amp; prayers from millions of Americans for President @realDonaldTrump &amp; @FLOTUS.

From day one, this President has stood strong for the first freedom of every American—religious freedom.

President @realDonaldTrump &amp; I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest. But the rioting &amp; looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech. We will have LAW &amp; ORDER in every city in America!
For months, all Joe Biden talked about was peaceful protesters, as the American people watched businesses and communities in our major cities burn.
Iowa is WINNING under President @realDonaldTrump 🇺🇸: \n✅ more than 11,000 jobs\n✅ lowest unemployment in 20 years\n✅ America first!

I've got news for the Democrats &amp; Hollywood elites: That dogma lives loudly in me. That dogma lives loudly in you. And the American people have the right to live, to work, and worship according to the dictates of our faith. The attacks on Judge Barrett's faith must stop!
During Judge Amy Coney Barrett's last confirmation hearing the Democrat chairman of the Judiciary committee criticized her Catholic faith, saying "The dogma lives loudly within you." Hollywood elites have already begun to criticize her and her family for their faith.

Let me be clear: Rioting and looting is not free speech. Bringing violence against civilians or law enforcement will not be tolerated, and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
The men and women of law enforcement are the best in America and they deserve the respect of every American! This Administration will always stand with those on the Thin Blue Line! https://t.co/W4UkUfcZDT

We don't agree with Speaker Pelosi that "nothing" is better than "something" for workers.\n\nSenators will vote on more relief next week, including more PPP money to stop layoffs. We'll be able to pass it before we turn to Judge Barrett's nomination unless Democrats block it again. https://t.co/paJFhx5HcI
Judge Barrett is just as brilliant and impressive as advertised. She is clearly qualified. She's committed to fairness and impartiality. And she clearly understands the job of a judge under the Constitution is to apply the law and not impose personal policy views.
The far left has been threatening our basic institutions of government since long before this Supreme Court vacancy. When today's Democrats lose one election or one vote on the Senate floor, they start threatening to tear up the rulebook. https://t.co/CT3rnShGZD
Judge Barrett is a stellar nominee. I think the president picked the single best person he could have picked anywhere in the country. This is a woman of extraordinary achievement. https://t.co/E1pyp1PPHU
ICYMI: I joined @marthamaccallum to discuss the Senate's months of success with hybrid hearings, Judge Barrett's outstanding qualifications, and Democrats' refusal to get serious on COVID-19 relief talks. https://t.co/QrBro8587T
The ongoing attacks by Senate Democrats and the media on Judge Barrett's faith are a disgrace. They demean the confirmation process, disrespect the Constitution, and insult millions of American believers. https://t.co/Qg5mFQzWFO
President Trump made an outstanding choice in Judge Amy Coney Barrett. She is one of the finest legal minds of her generation. She's won national admiration for her example of strong female leadership. She's exactly the kind of person Americans deserve on their highest Court. https://t.co/eYEle2s1nw
Judge Barrett's hearings will begin one week from today. Chairman Graham has all the tools to conduct a hybrid hearing, just like the 150 others the Senate has held this year.\n \nWe will not stop working for the American people because Democrats are afraid they may lose a vote.
Democrats say they'll try everything to stall Judge Barrett. The latest excuse: Hybrid hearings with some virtual participation are suddenly bad. \n\nThe Senate has held 150 of these hybrid hearings since May. Democrats have taken advantage of the tools. They've praised the format.
Just had another great call with @POTUS. He sounds well and says he's feeling good. We talked about the people's business — fighting the pandemic, confirming Judge Barrett, and strengthening the economy for American families. Let's keep our President &amp; First Lady in our prayers.
Senate floor proceedings will be postponed until October 19th. The @SenJudiciary confirmation hearings for Judge Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court will convene on October 12th as scheduled by Chairman Graham. My full statement: https://t.co/7ThKZPJBZG
ICYMI: I joined @HughHewitt this morning to discuss Judge Barrett's outstanding qualifications, the decision by some on the left to attack her religious faith, and the Democrats' ongoing threats against our governing institutions. https://t.co/Ze5EbW63qH
Just finished a great phone call with @POTUS. He's in good spirits and we talked business — especially how impressed Senators are with the qualifications of Judge Barrett. Full steam ahead with the fair, thorough, timely process that the nominee, the Court, &amp; the country deserve.
Happy to hear the White House physician's report that @POTUS and @FLOTUS are feeling well following their positive tests for COVID-19. Let's continue to pray today and every day for our President and our First Lady and for all those impacted by COVID-19.
Tune in now to @BretBaier. I'll be discussing Judge Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court and the Democrats' ongoing obstruction of more bipartisan COVID-19 relief.
Everyone who knows Judge Barrett, across the political spectrum, praises her independence and impartiality.\n\nA judge's job is to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIt's revealing how much this basic concept seems to scare the far left.
Democrats want to pack the Supreme Court. Vice President Biden refused to rule it out last night. Now Senate Democrats are demanding promises and pre-commitments from Judge Barrett.\n \nJudicial independence is vital to the rule of law. Why are Republicans alone in defending it?
Judge Barrett is an exemplary judge and a qualified nominee for the Supreme Court. Her legal peers across the political spectrum praise her independence, fair-mindedness, and impartiality. That is exactly what the American people deserve on their highest Court. https://t.co/Eawb6JuCeX
Multiple times, with multiple nominees, Senate Democrats have said or implied that certain personal religious beliefs make Americans unfit to serve. Judge Barrett in 2017 was only one example. Now the media's joining in.\n\nThese tactics need to stop now. https://t.co/wisPUKXe2O
I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Barrett earlier today. President Trump has nominated exactly the kind of outstanding person whom the American people deserve to have on their highest Court. https://t.co/0tTJqPwpeP
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptionally impressive jurist and an exceedingly well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court.\n \nA brilliant scholar. An exemplary judge. President Trump could not have made a better decision. https://t.co/FKadx6TJeU
Tune in: I'm about to join @ShannonBream @foxnewsnight for my first interview on the Supreme Court vacancy. The Senate will do what we did in 2016: Follow history, follow precedent, and do the job we were elected to do.
The far left called John Paul Stevens anti-woman. They said Anthony Kennedy would turn back the clock. David Souter was going to hurt "women, minorities, dissenters, &amp; other groups\" from the bench.\n \nAnyone doubt the same old smears will be rearing their heads starting Saturday?
We don't know which legal all-star the President will nominate on Saturday. So isn't it curious that everyone already knows exactly what smears and scare tactics the far left will trot out?\n \nTheir playbook has not changed for 45 years. The nominee is irrelevant to their attacks.
My full statement on Breonna Taylor, yesterday's announcement, and the violence overnight in my hometown of Louisville: https://t.co/NN70M9oun8
The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th. There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.
House Democrats' first government funding bill intentionally left rural America behind. But @SenJoniErnst and other Republicans did not let the Democrats defund farm country. They secured the Commodity Credit Corporation funding that our farmers and ranchers depend on.
Yesterday, Sen. Schumer decided to vent his frustration by blocking a bipartisan Intelligence Committee meeting on counterintelligence with a leading expert on protecting our elections.\n\nA partisan temper tantrum is one thing. Jeopardizing national security is a different story.
Rewarding Democrats' tactics now would not stop their attacks on our institutions. Their threats predate this new vacancy by over a year.\n \nTheir recklessness only underscores the importance that we do our job and confirm a nominee who truly respects the Constitution.
Democrats are threatening to attack the foundations of the Senate and the Court if they do not get their way.\n \nHere's the problem with this attempted blackmail: They have already been making these threats for many months. They've been campaigning on them for over a year.
Our Senate majority will do exactly the same thing in 2020 that we did in 2016: Follow Senate history, follow the clear precedent in each situation, and do exactly the job we were elected to do.\n \nWe are going to vote on President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court this year.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a generational legal giant and a trailblazing champion for American women. The Senate is grieving with the nation, praying for her family, and remembering her historic legacy.\n\nMy full Senate floor remarks: https://t.co/mfVTHURqIw
House Democrats' rough draft of a government funding bill shamefully leaves out key relief and support that American farmers need. This is no time to add insult to injury and defund help for farmers and rural America.
The Senate and the nation mourn the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the conclusion of her extraordinary American life.\n\nMy full statement: https://t.co/NOwYLhDxIk
Today we honor National POW/MIA Recognition Day. More than 1300 patriotic Kentuckians still haven't come home. They are not forgotten, and we are still searching.
ICYMI: I joined the @GuyBensonShow to discuss Speaker Pelosi holding up relief for Americans, Senate Democrats' filibuster hypocrisy, and Democrats playing politics with election security. https://t.co/ioFcheGe0P
In 2019, under Republican policies:\n\n- Fastest annual growth in household income on record\n- Working-class &amp; middle-class families saw more of the gains\n- Poverty lowest since 1950s\n \nThat's the leadership our nation will need as we rebuild after COVID. https://t.co/Byrmh3DgD8
It's been less than a year since my bill with Senator Kaine and @SenToddYoung raised the nationwide age for tobacco purchases to 21. We just learned there's already been a major decline in e-cigarette use among young people. Huge bipartisan progress for the health of our kids. https://t.co/yosvf0SA56
Even Speaker Pelosi's own House Democrats are sick of her blocking COVID-19 relief.\n\nBut she insists anything short of her multi-trillion wish list would make Democrats "a cheap date." What a joke.\n\nPeople are hurting. They need help. Not the Speaker's pointless political games.
Today is an historic day for Middle East peace. Landmark agreements formalized at the White House between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain. Thanks to the U.S. and the Trump administration, the winds of change are blowing across toward progress and peace.
The framers designed the Senate to be the country's firewall against bad ideas and radical change. If Democrats are afraid their bad ideas could never meet the bar, it's their proposals that need to be scrapped, not our country's checks and balances.
Great news: Experts have found a huge decline in teen vaping. This is just what we sought with my landmark legislation to increase the required age for all tobacco products to 21. Health officials say that law made a big difference. https://t.co/dqhz6fhQwg
The Trump administration has helped secured two historic peace agreements between Israel and Arab nations in just the last few days. The winds of change are blowing and the Middle East is changing for the better. My full statement: https://t.co/FDbUKWrCpN
Senate Democrats are threatening to blow up the filibuster if they gain power and ram far-left policies through the Senate. But they just used the filibuster last week to block COVID relief. They used it this summer to kill @SenatorTimScott's police reform bill.\n\nTotal hypocrisy.
All military families serve alongside their loved ones in uniform. The new Gold Star Families Memorial in Owensboro, KY commemorates the sacrifices these patriots made in the name of freedom. The nation can never repay our debt. But we can keep these families in our prayers. https://t.co/5bZkjgwqlB
Washington Democrats have now blocked two separate proposals to provide hundreds of billions of dollars for safe schools, jobs, and healthcare. They just do not want American families getting more help before the election. Pure cynicism.
Nineteen years ago, thousands of Americans were murdered by terrorists. National landmarks burned. Brave first responders put their lives on the line to save strangers.\n \nMay we never fail to honor them. And may we never tire of our pledge: Never Again. https://t.co/95QqWlm05m
ICYMI I joined @DanaPerino to discuss Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer's continued efforts to block coronavirus relief funding for Americans. \n \nEvery Senator who voted against relief needs to answer what in the proposal they actually disagreed with. Kids? Jobs? Healthcare? https://t.co/iuGc7fN01A
Every Senate Democrat just voted against hundreds of billions of dollars of COVID-19 relief. They blocked money for schools, testing, vaccines, unemployment insurance, and the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nTheir goal is clear: No help for American families before the election.
Yesterday, reporters asked Sen. Schumer whether by refusing to compromise, he was making the perfect the enemy of the good. His response? "Republicans are the enemy of the good."\n\nAmericans are not enemies. COVID-19 is our enemy. It's time for Washington Democrats to act like it.
The Senate is voting today on COVID-19 relief. Hundreds of billions more dollars to make schools safe for kids, to keep workers getting paid, and to invest in treatments and vaccines.\n\nAmerican families will see exactly which Senators want to send them more bipartisan help.
Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer were attacking our new COVID proposal before they'd even read it.\n\nThey're attacking it over provisions that literally have Democrat cosponsors.\n\nThey just don't want Americans getting another cent of bipartisan relief before the November election.
The coronavirus doesn't care about our election. But it's clear that's all Democrats care about. Look at the facts and ask each Democrat what in the proposal that we're voting on tomorrow they actually disagree with. \n\nMore historic funding for schools? Jobs? Healthcare? https://t.co/p38BQjgvKM
This year's Kentucky Derby showed our great traditions can adapt to overcome any challenge. But our sport must be protected. \n\nI've been proud to stand up for horseracing throughout my career. Today, I'm introducing new legislation to keep up that support. https://t.co/3sU5juOUCI
Republicans will not let Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer kill COVID relief behind closed doors without putting every Senator on the record.\n\nTomorrow, we'll vote to protect workers' paychecks, keep kids safe in school, and win the healthcare fight against the virus.
Republicans have built yet another effort to help Americans. Money for schools. Resources for parents. Testing. Vaccines. Another round of the job-saving PPP. And more.\n\nThe Senate will be voting this week. The nation will see who's serious about making law for American families.
Democrats have blocked any new COVID relief, saying anything short of their entire far-left wish list is "piecemeal" and "emaciated."\n \nThe same Democrats rushed back to D.C. to pass piecemeal legislation for the Postal Service that did nothing at all for working families.
Republicans have spent months fighting for more COVID-19 relief. We proposed a major $1T bill. Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer said no. We suggested smaller bipartisan deals. They said no again.\n \nToday we put forward yet another proposal. They attacked it before even reading it.
Republicans and Democrats have big differences, but they should not stop us from agreeing where we can and making law to help Americans through this crisis. Working families cannot suffer more because Democrats think their pain helps them politically. The Senate is going to vote. https://t.co/HzbPxvRe9I
But Republicans are not done fighting for the American people. Today our majority is introducing a targeted proposal for kids, jobs, and healthcare to help with many of our most urgent challenges. No more obstruction behind closed doors. Every Senator will be going on the record. https://t.co/N7QdjXrQql
Senate Republicans have been trying for months to deliver more COVID-19 relief to American families. Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer have blocked us at every turn. Every action has suggested they simply do not want families to get any more bipartisan help before the election. https://t.co/nEPUDXBzIt
As Kentuckians, Thoroughbred racing is practically in our bones. It's who we are. We find our state's unique history on the track &amp; in the stables.

The coronavirus does not care about the election. Struggling Americans need our help now, and that can only happen if Washington Democrats stop playing games and actually help the American people. https://t.co/Xy2ixCAE7A
From homegrown hemp masks to distilleries making hand sanitizer, Kentuckians are leading by example. We're going to keep working together to beat this virus. https://t.co/ll44Cdk9k5
Republicans are committed to making sure the Postal Service remains well equipped to fulfill its important duties. But the Senate will not pass stand-alone legislation for the Postal Service while American families continue to go without the help they need.
If Washington Democrats would devote half the energy they spend worrying about their own re-elections to actually helping the American people, we could easily achieve the kind of targeted, bipartisan relief package that Republicans have wanted for weeks.
House Democrats have spent weeks ignoring the urgent needs of American workers and families, but they rushed back to Washington the instant that overblown conspiracy theories about the U.S. Postal Service convinced them their own jobs might be in jeopardy. My full statement: https://t.co/41VdckTLw0

No family in middle America is saying: \"Thank goodness the Democrats are blocking cash payments to me, money for my kids' schools, and money for vaccines until Manhattan millionaires get a tax cut!\"\n\nWhat American families everywhere want is an outcome. https://t.co/wsoLaPKaH5
Democrats' latest spin: They've moved from a $3.5 trillion, far-left, non-COVID-related wish list to a $2.5 trillion, far-left, non-COVID-related wish list and insist the White House meet them there.\n\nThat's not a reality-based negotiation. It's throwing spaghetti at the wall. https://t.co/QmHTA0WdMu
President Trump deserves great credit for bringing about this historic step forward for the Middle East. The commitment to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates represents tremendous progress toward greater peace and prosperity across the region. https://t.co/uFTatL2xDa
The PPP saved Main Street jobs across Kentucky. It sent more than $5B in payroll support to our state. But the recovery is not finished. Hard-hit businesses need a second draw, and Republicans proposed one.\n\nBut Democrats are blocking it over non-COVID-related wish-list items.
Americans need relief, and that means focusing on what's directly related to COVID-19: Kids, jobs, healthcare, and legal protections for re-opening.\n\nI applaud the President for taking action during this emergency to get help to Americans who are struggling. https://t.co/5xatB6FalX
The Speaker &amp; Democratic Leader say not another dime for testing, treatments, or vaccines unless they get a huge tax cut for blue-state millionaires.\n \nTaking our health system hostage over longtime, non-COVID-related, liberal demands.\n \nThis is a crisis. Let's govern like it.
Tune in now to @FoxNews: I'm joining @BillHemmer to discuss Democrats' decision to play hardball with vulnerable Americans who need help and hurt our nation's chance to get on offense against the virus.
The Speaker and the Democratic Leader say they won't allow another cent for families, schools, or the PPP unless they get a trillion-dollar state government slush fund, way beyond COVID needs.\n \nThese unrelated liberal demands are blocking billions in aid that families need now.
The New York Times proclaims Democrats are "Playing Hardball on Coronavirus Relief."\n \n"Playing" is right — they're treating this like a political game.\n \nFamilies are suffering. Americans are dying. This isn't a game, it's a crisis. Our country needs Democrats to act like it.
Because of Democrats' obstruction, the extra federal unemployment aid expired. The PPP is closed with no second round in sight. No new money for testing or schools. No second round of checks to families. Democrats held all this hostage for non-COVID-related liberal priorities.
I hoped this week we'd be finalizing major legislation. After all, American families are struggling and need help. But Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer decided not to deliver. I am glad the president stepped in to soften the blow of their hostage tactics.
Struggling Americans need action now. I am glad that President Trump is proving that while Democrats use laid-off workers as political pawns, Republicans will actually look out for them. My full statement: https://t.co/5uEu6PSUGH
I appreciate Director Evanina's report on foreign powers' efforts to divide us and interfere in our politics. I am confident American voters will reject the fear-mongering that seeks to undermine confidence in our elections. My full statement: https://t.co/3YzvOFsbOy
Some predicted weeks ago that Democratic leaders did not actually want another bipartisan rescue package to pass, and would sabotage negotiations by refusing to come an inch toward the White House in these talks. Have Americans seen anything at all to disprove that?
ICYMI, I joined @FoxNews to discuss Democrats' obstruction of the COVID-19 relief negotiations, how Republicans tried to keep extra unemployment benefits from expiring, and the need to keep small-business aid flowing. https://t.co/rwGyAXgzIB
Democrats' obstruction last week forced the additional federal unemployment benefit to expire. Their obstruction this week will force another deadline: the PPP shuts its doors Saturday. Republicans had plans to keep both from expiring. Democrats have refused them all.
Tune in now to @CNBC. I am joining @SquawkStreet to discuss Senate Republicans' plan to help struggling Americans who are facing the mounting consequences of Democrats' inaction. Our nation needs a bipartisan outcome, and they need it now.
Tune in now to @FoxNews Special Report. I am joining @MikeEmanuelFox to discuss Senate Republicans' plan to help working families, small businesses, and healthcare heroes navigate this new phase of the pandemic.
Our country is facing bigger problems than whether Malibu gets to upgrade its street-sweepers. Struggling families need help now. Democratic leaders must stop blocking aid to Americans over their unrelated left-wing wish list. https://t.co/PHu90VDeJd
I extend the Senate's condolences to the people of Lebanon following yesterday's horrific explosion in Beirut. My full statement: https://t.co/VEEBeuzcwf
Democratic leaders say they'll keep blocking federal unemployment aid unless we pay people more to stay home than to work. That isn't just bad economics, it's unfair. We should not be taxing essential workers to pay their neighbors a higher salary to stay home. https://t.co/tFN55kRv4P
We need to urgently help working families and those who've lost their jobs. But the Speaker and the Democratic Leader are blocking the entire rescue package over a special, unrelated tax cut for rich people in high-tax blue states.
Speaker Pelosi is still holding up this entire package over bizarre unrelated things like carveouts for the marijuana industry. She even claimed to the press that pot is a proven COVID-19 therapy!\n \nI hope she's shared this breakthrough with Dr. Fauci.\n \nCan we get serious yet? https://t.co/CksSWrMKDN
President Trump just signed the Great American Outdoors Act into law. The GAOA will protect our country's natural treasures and promote recreation and conservation for generations — thanks to the strong leadership of @SenCoryGardner and @SteveDaines. https://t.co/bpicVZ891j
Senate Republicans proposed a major rescue package: A trillion dollars for kids, jobs, and healthcare. But Democrats are blocking it all. The American people need a bipartisan outcome, not Democrats' stonewalling behind closed doors.
The Senate mourns the young American servicemembers who were tragically lost while training last week. Our sympathies are with their families and our gratitude is with all the personnel who led the tireless search. https://t.co/EVvIqWp0ZA
Republicans tried several ways to extend unemployment benefits. Democrats blocked them all. They're refusing any more COVID relief for anyone unless they get a massive tax cut for rich people in blue states.\n\nThe country can't afford this cynicism. Americans need help now.
ICYMI: I joined @FoxNews @marthamaccallum to continue discussing Senate Republicans' efforts to help get kids back in school, put workers back on the clock, and equip our healthcare heroes to finish the fight. https://t.co/zsGnedPO4a
Democrats are holding up urgent help for struggling people over completely unrelated liberal wish-list items, like massive tax cuts for rich people in blue states. Economists across the spectrum say it's a terrible idea. This is how serious they are about these negotiations.
ICYMI: I joined @JudyWoodruff on @NewsHour to discuss the importance of helping schools and employers safely reopen, and delivering new relief to working families in need. For the country's sake, Democrats need to come to the table. https://t.co/iTB5o9iHm9
Senate Republicans tried several ways to extend the expiring unemployment assistance. Democrats blocked them all and refused another dime for COVID-19 relief unless they get to pass a bill that includes an unrelated tax cut for rich people in blue states. https://t.co/Vl4krLjMIr
There's a fact of life here in the United States Senate: It takes 60 votes to legislate. So the American people cannot get any of the additional relief that Republicans want to give them unless Democrats will come to the table.
The coronavirus does not care that we are divided. The coronavirus will not care if Washington Democrats decide it suits their partisan goals to let relief run dry.\n\nThe American people are hurting and Congress should have their backs.
The historic CARES Act has helped families endure this crisis. But our nation is not done with this fight. More Americans are dying. Millions are unemployed. Added federal unemployment benefits are close to expiring.\n\nDemocrats need to get serious and come to the table.
I joined @CNBC to discuss Senate Republican's HEALS Act. \n\nThe pandemic is not finished. The economic pain is not finished. So Congress cannot be finished either. Republicans are ready to govern. We just need Democrats to decide whether they are serious about making law. https://t.co/aM30wub8rT
Tune in now to @CNBC. I am joining @kaylatausche ~3:05 PM ET to discuss Senate Republicans' HEALS Act — our framework for another round of historic relief to American workers and families.
Our Democratic colleagues want to pretend it is controversial that taxpayers should not pay people more not to work than the people who do go back to work. The American people don't call that a controversy. They call that common sense. They call that basic fairness. https://t.co/8N7s4ySlV4
Our nation stands at a challenging crossroads. We have one foot in this pandemic and one foot in the recovery. What the American people need is a smart, safe, and sustainable middle ground. \n \nThey need Congress's help to construct it. That's exactly what the HEALS Act would do.
Republicans have created a serious framework. The question is whether Democrats will come to the table in good faith. In March, when they did, we passed the CARES Act unanimously. In June, when they didn't, police reform collapsed.\n\nIt will take bipartisanship to make law.
We have produced a tailored and targeted bill that will address each of the three distinct crises facing our country: Getting kids back in school, getting workers back to work, and winning the healthcare fight against the virus.\nKids, jobs, and healthcare.
COVID-19 has killed nearly 150,000 Americans. 17 million people are out of work. The virus is still with us and the American people need more help. That is why Senate Republicans are introducing a new comprehensive rescue package today: https://t.co/OKqk1ZyA2D
This terrible virus is still with us and America's fight continues. Across the country, by taking commonsense steps – like wearing a mask and practicing social distancing – we'll get through this together. https://t.co/0BRIa8bw13
The CARES Act provided Kentucky and our nation with the tools to endure the first phase of the coronavirus crisis. But America's fight continues, so Congress's support for our people must continue as well. CARES 2 will focus on three things: Kids, jobs, and healthcare. https://t.co/l70w1h7jF0
The Senate majority has assembled a framework for CARES 2. It is tailored precisely to this phase of the crisis to deliver more relief to the American people. It represents an agreement in principle with the administration, and will be introduced next week.
Our nation stands at a critical midway point in our fight against the coronavirus. Far too many families are continuing to face serious healthcare and economic challenges. So Congress' support for our people must continue as well.
The Senate just advanced the 60th annual National Defense Authorization Act to keep our Armed Forces on the cutting edge as they protect America, our allies, and our interest around the world. https://t.co/FPcM4R7SgZ
The House just passed @SteveDaines and @SenCoryGardner ‘s Great American Outdoors Act. Next stop: The White House to be signed into law. https://t.co/yRJRl1Ltpp

Today, the Senate will vote on a Democrat amendment to slash defense spending that was advertised in an op-ed titled "Defund the Pentagon."\n\nFrom defunding the police to defunding the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nRepublicans are going to stand firm and defeat this unhinged policy. https://t.co/h4KQfcVoyQ
The American people cannot completely stop building their lives until a vaccine is available. The U.S.A. was not built for a defensive crouch. We need to smartly, safely stand up an educational system and an economy that works for workers and families in the meantime. https://t.co/kEtPNydhKe
At the outset of this crisis, the Senate wrote and passed the historic, bipartisan CARES Act. It helped pull our health system and economy back from the brink. But this crisis is far from over. The American people still need help. So the Senate must act again.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. famously said "the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice." Our nation has bent toward justice because heroes like John Lewis took it upon themselves to lead the way. We celebrate the life of this American hero. https://t.co/uyy3rOOn1U
Our country can't afford a second epidemic of frivolous lawsuits while we fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The next relief package should focus on four things: Jobs, healthcare, kids in school, and liability protections for those helping us fight the coronavirus. https://t.co/cR17sxbtl1
I will never forget joining hands with John as Congress sang We Shall Overcome at a 2008 ceremony honoring his friend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It could not have been more humbling to consider what he had suffered and sacrificed so those words could be sung in that place.

Any future COVID relief package needs to be measured, with a focus on getting kids back in school safely, workers back on the job, and delivering liability protections for individuals related to the coronavirus crisis. https://t.co/hr156jY2b2
Expanding the availability of testing is one of the best ways to slow the spread of the coronavirus. We've seen American ingenuity mobilize a full-scale response to this crisis and I'm grateful to the Kentuckians and American heroes who continue to step up to this challenge. https://t.co/a1Lg1I6wgS

We can't get our country back to normal unless we have kids in school. That's what a future COVID relief would focus on, along with jobs, healthcare, and liability protections. https://t.co/IuFy09vDuE

Turns out, Americans love America.
This President has shared private moments like this with families of soldiers, victims of violent crime, and people who've had businesses destroyed by the mob and natural disasters. \n\nThat's the President I know.
I walked through the door, and said "Todd, the President wants to talk to you." \n\nFor the next five minutes, family and friends sat in complete silence, as the President of the United States took time to talk to a dad who was hurting.
I then said, "Mr. President, I'm actually walking into their house right now. Obviously, they don't know I'm talking to you. But if you'd be willing to say hello to Eli's dad, you'd make a terrible day a little less terrible." \n\n"What's his name?" The President asked.
We talked about a few issues. And then he asked how the family was doing. \n\nI said they're doing "ok, but it's tough."  \n\nThe President said "Yea. Losing a loved one's always difficult, and it's really tough when they're so young."
It was a Saturday morning, three days after the accident. I was walking to the car, to go to Eli's parent's home, when the President called.
Two years ago, our nephew Eli was killed in a car accident. He lived a mile from us. Grew up wrestling and training with our boys. Was a high school state champion. Varsity athlete for Wisconsin.
President Trump truly cares about the American people. \n\nOur family's seen it.
Was it the Postal Service's fault: \n\n-That it took New York six weeks to count votes in their Democratic primary? No.\n\nThat New Jersey was still counting ballots four weeks after their primary? No.\n\nThat it took the Democrats a month to figure out who won the Iowa Caucuses? No. https://t.co/aqZwz8mAZ9

The Obama/Biden Administration spied on the Trump Campaign. \n\nJoe Biden suggested using the Logan Act to take down Michael Flynn.\n\nIt's one of the worst scandals in American history.\n\nAnd most in the media and on the Left ignore it.
Don't overplay it? \n\nPresident Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. \n\nSome newspapers, however, should give back their Pulitzers for their phony Russia coverage. \nhttps://t.co/cC2zB995e3
Democrats have politicized:\n\n-#COVIDー19 \n-Going to church\n-Going to school\n-Going to work\n-Defending your home\n-College football\n-And now, the post office\n\nThe Left should stop harassing Americans who just want to live their lives.
Let me get this straight: \n\n-Philadelphia asked citizens to turn in their guns.\n-A few dozen guns were collected. \n-It didn't make a dent in crime.\n\nDid the bad guys not turn in their guns too? \n\nShocking. \n\nhttps://t.co/mEtiWsC6YJ

I love South Carolina. It is my home. It is the best place in the world to raise a family and run a business. As long as I am your senator, I'll keep it that way.
Obamacare is a disaster - I know because I was on it.  My premiums went up 300% and my coverage stunk.  Under my plan, SC would get almost $1 billion in new funding, pre-existing condition coverage will be protected, and localities will be in charge, not a faceless DC bureaucrat.
My friend @SenatorTimScott had a great police reform package, and @SenSchumer shut it down. @HarrisonJaime sided with Schumer over Tim Scott, and he will every time.
Want to know what's at stake this election?  If we lose the Senate, socialist Bernie Sanders will become Budget Committee Chairman.  If we hold the Senate, and I am re-elected, I will be Budget Committee Chairman.
South Carolinians do not appreciate Harrison putting himself above others.  \n\nIf Mr. Harrison is not able to interact with South Carolinians on the same terms they live their lives, he should not be their senator.
Are South Carolina workers demanding all their coworkers and customers be tested before going to work? \n\nDo restaurants demand their staff &amp; customers be tested before opening?
Mr. Harrison is demanding special treatment.\n\nOther than Mr. Harrison, is any other South Carolinian demanding every person they come in contact with be tested before they meet?
Appears @harrisonjaime is skipping tonights debate.  \n\nMr. Harrision is ducking the debate because the more we know about his radical policies, the less likely he is to win. It's not about medicine, its politics.\n\nHis liberal views are a loser in South Carolina - and he knows it!

Democrats chose to set in motion rules changes to stack the court at the Circuit level and they chose to try to destroy Brett Kavanaugh's life to keep the Supreme Court seat open.\n \nYou reap what you sow.
Being lectured by Democrats about how to handle judicial nominations is like an arsonist advising the Fire Department.

I stand by what I said in Jan. 2019: Harry Reid &amp; Chuck Schumer changed Senate rules to try and stack the courts for Obama. Now it's coming back to haunt them as I predicted.

Jaime Harrison will be a loyal foot soldier in the cause of the radical liberals to destroy America as we know it.\n\nAs to me – I will be part of the Resistance and oppose their radical liberal agenda as they try to fundamentally change America.\n\n#5
I know Jaime Harrison -- who opposed the Kavanaugh nomination and joined the mob in the destruction of this fine man -- will oppose ANY Trump nominee.  \n\nI hope the people of South Carolina know that as well. \n\n#4
In light of these two events, I will support President @realDonaldTrump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg. \n\n#3
*  Harry Reid changed the rules to allow a simple majority vote for Circuit Court nominees dealing out the minority.\n\n* Chuck Schumer and his friends in the liberal media conspired to destroy the life of Brett Kavanaugh and hold that Supreme Court seat open.\n\n#2

@JoeBiden The US intelligence community and US military are strongly encouraging and supporting a small counter-terrorism force remaining in Afghanistan.

I urge the @FEC and others to investigate this situation. Is money being laundered through @ActBlue from straw donors or foreign governments to Democratic candidates, or is this legit? Somebody needs to find out ASAP.
Compared to @WINRED, only 4% of conservative donors were listed as unemployed. I don't believe Democrats are 12 times more likely to be unemployed than Republicans.
Wow – this sounds fishy as hell. Nearly 50% of liberal donors using @actblue were untraceable and listed as unemployed (with a 4% national unemployment rate).\nhttps://t.co/rv1Bqs9Luh

I strongly believe that my criticism of these trials is widely shared by members of the Senate in both parties.  \n\nTwo years later, we still don't have Mr. Khashoggi's remains or any sort of justice.
More is unknown about these trials than is known.  \n\nThese actions give sham trials a bad name.\n\nThis gruesome episode is not exactly the change one was hoping for when it comes to Saudi Arabia's behavior.
I am deeply disappointed about the lack of transparency in the trials of eight unnamed individuals in Saudi Arabia for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a permanent resident of the U.S.\n\nhttps://t.co/b0xmcwt5Zb

The residual US force, combined with Iraqi security forces and other partner nations, should be sufficient to prevent reemergence of ISIS and provide continued stability for Iraq -- both of which are in our national security interests.
The physical ISIS Caliphate has been destroyed and the Iraqi security forces are becoming more capable.   \n\nHowever, there remains a large number of ISIS-aligned fighters in Iraq and Syria who have the capability to reemerge en masse.
Due to conditions on the ground I support President @realDonaldTrump's decision to draw down to 3,000 American troops in Iraq. \n\nhttps://t.co/rriV16Ch3X
@realDonaldTrump The decision by President Trump to include South Carolina meets the desires of our coastal communities and state's leadership.  \n\nI very much appreciate President Trump for listening to our state and delivering for our people.
@realDonaldTrump After receiving positive feedback from Governor McMaster and state leaders, I led an effort to ensure President Trump included South Carolina in the announcement.
@realDonaldTrump When I first learned that there would be an extension of the ban on drilling off the Florida coast, I contacted South Carolina officials to gauge their interest.
@realDonaldTrump This issue has been a long time coming and I have worked extensively with President Trump about this issue as it relates to South Carolina.
Great news for South Carolina! \n\nI am very pleased President @realDonaldTrump listened to the desires of South Carolina and included our state in the extension of the current moratorium on offshore drilling.\n\nhttps://t.co/ekLz7y4GXm

Biden is reluctantly emerging from his basement to confront this issue because Americans -- and what they see taking place on the streets of our nation -- are afraid to come out of theirs.
Violence in our communities was never mentioned at the #DemConvention because Democrats simply did NOT want to go there.  \n\nYesterday, Joe Biden was forced to talk about violence in the streets because the American people are FORCING him to go there.  \n\nhttps://t.co/c4dHiQEYzM

Those of you who want to stand up and fight the socialists poisoning our schools and burning our cities — join me in supporting President Trump.
So to our soldiers and their families – join me in supporting President Trump. \n\nThose of you who want lower taxes and better, less expensive healthcare, join me in supporting President Trump.
If you hate war like I hate war…if you want us to quit sending $50 billion to Afghanistan for luxury hotels and natural gas to stations…you need to support President Trump for another term!
I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported wars in Serbia, Syria, and Libya. Joe Biden will continue to spill our blood and treasure. President Trump will bring our heroes home.
Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War, which President Trump has long called our generation's worst geopolitical mistake.
I'm proud to see a President who agrees with that finally. \n\n Compare President Trump with the disastrous record of Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, who consistently called for more war.
President Trump is the first President in a generation to seek to end war rather than start one. He intends to end the war in Afghanistan. He is bringing our men and women home. \n\n Madison once wrote, \"No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.\"
I flew with him to Dover Air Force Base to honor two soldiers whose remains were coming home from Afghanistan. I will never forget that night. I can tell you the President not only felt the pain of these families but is committed to ending this war.
I'm supporting President Trump because he believes as I do that a strong America cannot fight endless wars. \n\nWe must not continue to leave our blood and treasure in Middle East quagmires.
While others talked about criminal justice reform, President Trump signed the First Step Act, the first real reform in a generation, and one that sought to undo the harm that others, like Joe Biden, have done.
I brought President Trump an idea for better, cheaper health insurance called Association Health Plans. Donald Trump overturned years of red tape and bureaucrats and made it happen.
When some in Congress wanted a so-called \"revenue neutral\" tax plan, Donald Trump and I worked together to make sure it was a real tax cut.
But more important than simple agreements are accomplishments. \n\nPresident Donald Trump gets things done.
I'm proud of the job Donald Trump has done as President. \n\nI don't always agree with him. But our occasional policy differences are far outweighed by our significant agreements.
A few years later, we were opponents, both running for President. \n\nWe all know how that turned out.
We performed hundreds of surgeries in both countries. Nothing is more beautiful to me in this world than removing the bandages from a person's eyes and watching them as they see their loved ones again. Donald Trump helped me make that happen.
Not only did he support my medical mission to Guatemala, but he also contributed to another mission trip to Haiti a year later.
I was planning a medical mission to Guatemala to perform charity eye surgeries. We needed money to fund the trip.  Donald Trump offered to help and immediately came through for those kids and us.

Teachers, if you want to teach in-person, we support you. We've provided $13 billion for PPE, cleaning and training. If your health requires you to teach virtually, we support you. We have proposed more flexible and personalized funding for PD to improve teacher preparation. 5/6
If you want or need to send your child to school in-person, we support you. If virtual learning is best for your family, we support you. If you want to attend a school other than your government-assigned public school, we support you. 4/6

"Their children are often in self-contained classrooms with just six students, and the parents believe there are ways to safely educate them offline, even if the entire student population isn't ready to go back."
"In the conversations about whether to reopen school buildings—or even how to shape virtual learning—parents of special education students fear that the unique needs of their children are not being urgently considered."
Ethan, a special ed student born w/ polymicrogyria has missed months of physical therapy and "has been angrier and more physically aggressive." His mother said that "if the computer isn't playing Sesame Street he slams the laptop down…It's been frustrating and a waste of time."
"And in Loudoun County, 8-year-old Theo Duran, who is autistic, struggles more to walk up the stairs or hold a crayon to write—all tasks he was making progress on before the coronavirus pandemic hit and shut down his school."
Some parents described virtual sessions as so ineffective that they just skipped them. Heinegg said for her son "It was extremely damaging to his self-esteem...I have spent years and lots of energy making sure he loves learning, and that was destroyed. How do you undo that?"
"Ayo Heinegg's son, a rising sixth-grader in the District with dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, is typically a high-performing student. But he struggled to keep up with his coursework on multiple online platforms and lost his confidence in the classroom."
Gibson said that "When school went virtual, it was hard to learn online—I had never done that before…I'm mad because I want to go to school. And I am hearing different days of when we go back to school. I miss my teachers, and I miss my friends."
Antwon Gibson's high school \"didn't even attempt to teach his ‘independent living' class virtually this spring. The gregarious 18-year-old has an intellectual disability and reads and performs math below grade level. He's been out of the classroom since schools closed in March…"
.@washingtonpost: "Parents across the country who have students w/ special ed needs say the stakes are high if schools do not reopen...children are not just falling behind academically...but missing developmental milestones &amp; losing key skills necessary for an independent life."
I've been called the \"School Choice Secretary\" by some. I think it's meant as an insult, but I wear it as a badge of honor. #COVID19 has laid bare there is no one-size-fits-all solution for education—it must be centered in what's best for students and families. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/T8xcfTNoXA

This is why @POTUS and I are fighting to put parents in charge of their children's education. Read the full article here: https://t.co/H1h21Rl5cJ
"We got a letter from the superintendent saying…more than 70% of parents surveyed…wanted...full in-person instruction or a hybrid model...the next paragraph says we're going full remote, which just struck me…as odd," said Doug Reed, a father of two.
A former High School teacher, Kathryn Rose said she understands why teachers are wary of returning to the classroom…but urged everyone to \"acknowledge and accept there are other bad outcomes without in-person instruction, like loss of learning and increased abuse and neglect\"
"@ChiPubSchools parent Nancy Curran said she's afraid her son Oliver…who is in a special ed program, will be ill-served by more remote learning if the city's schools don't reopen…she said online instruction is unrealistic &amp; frustrating for many students with special ed plans."
After learning District 65 is starting school w/ remote learning, Jessica Hockett decided to home-school her kids instead. "I had hoped they'd get the kids back in school at the start of the school year, even if it was some kind of hybrid choice.\"
Mairin Gradek's optimism that schools would reopen was buoyed by survey results: 75% of parents supported an in-person or hybrid plan. Remote learning trailed in 3rd place. But, recently, District 25 joined a list of school systems that have abandoned hopes of bringing kids back.
"Many parents say they feel like they're part of a silent majority, whose desire to have their children back in school has been pushed aside by school officials who are buckling to pressure from teachers unions." The @ChicagoTribune published several parent stories worth reading:
#SchoolChoice is about recognizing parents' inherent right to choose how and where their child is educated. This pandemic has made clear parents need that power now more than ever before. This administration will keep fighting until every family has #SchoolChoiceNow. https://t.co/HZdzxsV4po
Denisha is proof that #SchoolChoice works. Not only did it change the trajectory of her life, she's now an advocate who fights every day for students like her to have the same opportunity. Listen to her story in her own words. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/B0E6BgnxQw
President @realDonaldTrump and I trust parents. We believe in students. Each of them deserves the opportunity to go back to school this fall in the ways and places that will work best for them and their families. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/j6o3NbBW5d
The entire editorial is a MUST READ: https://t.co/4T4IdRGAsT 4/4
\"If there's a silver lining, it's...getting a closer look at the true...character of the unions. They are allies of the political left. And they wield monopoly power that they are using to coerce parents and taxpayers to dance to their agenda if they want children to learn.\" 3/4
The unions \"have a cynical interest in forcing their competitors to shut down. What a humiliation it would be if charter and private schools reopen and demonstrate that in-person education can be done...Or if parents...decide a private school would be better for their child.\" 2/4
.@WSJ editorial today: "Rather than work to open schools safely, the unions are issuing ultimatums and threatening strikes until they are granted their ideological wish list. Children, who would have to endure more lost instruction, are their hostages." 1/4
Walter explains why #SchoolChoice is "the great equalizer"—how it can not only break the cycle of poverty but truly change lives. This is why @SenatorTimScott's #SchoolChoiceNow Act is so important. ALL students deserve the same opportunity Walter had. https://t.co/cF9d89Hlbm
Congratulations to the many outstanding K-12 teachers and #STEM mentors recognized by @POTUS this year as #PAEMST and #PAESMEM awardees! Thank you for all you do to guide and support students in STEM!  https://t.co/bfI4VPukiD
Deborah felt like a quality education was out of reach for her son—that it was something reserved for only the rich and elite. A scholarship through #DCOSP was the catalyst that changed her son's life. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/zxX6PcClei
Great to be with @VP @Mike_Pence at @Thales_Academy! The students in Mrs. Combs' 4th Grade Class told me how much they missed their friends and how happy they are to be back together. This school has done tremendous work to safely reopen and get kids back to learning. https://t.co/ztxH9vuWZw
The #COVID19 pandemic has made clear now is the time to #RethinkEducation. @usedgov announced $180M+ in new grant funding for 11 states doing just that. Congrats LA, TN, RI, TX, IA, GA, SC, NY, NC, SD, ME on creating innovative ways to keep kids learning. https://t.co/pgMM6iZuKd
.@VP \"There has been no greater champion of #SchoolChoice...than @realDonaldTrump.\" We are committed to safely reopening schools &amp; doing what's right for students. If a school refuses to open, students need freedom to find one that will. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/ffEOJKjals
As we mark #ADA30 this weekend, let us celebrate this landmark civil rights legislation and the progress we've made with an eye toward the next 30 years and our continued commitment to fostering accessibility, inclusion, and independence for students with disabilities. https://t.co/Yr1MezPPoz
Students like Tryphena are why I get up and go to work every day. President @realDonaldTrump and I will continue to fight for her and all students who need #SchoolChoiceNow. https://t.co/NfTx6X0pDU
Tyreke has a bright future ahead of him! Through #SchoolChoice he was able to attend a school that met his unique learning needs and is thriving because of it. Finding the right fit for his education has given him the courage to pursue his dreams. https://t.co/an6KiFmi2O
I am so proud of Walter Blanks and the advocate he's become for students and #SchoolChoice. His work to make sure other kids have the same opportunities he did is truly inspiring. Thank you for all you do, Walter! #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/r1nv4aTJ2d
#SchoolChoice is life changing. I want to thank all the students, parents and educators who came out in Columbus today to share your stories. President @realDonaldTrump and I stand with you and with every child in America who needs #SchoolChoiceNow. https://t.co/P4hcHELo9v
Thank you @SenatorTimScott, @SenAlexander for your tireless support of students and of President @realDonaldTrump's plan to provide #SchoolChoiceNow to students across America. This bill must be part of any relief package to help all students return safely to school in the fall. https://t.co/nl57L2HE3G
#DCOSP has connected 10K+ low-income families to life-changing educational opportunities. Today, @usedgov announced $85M to further support its mission. @POTUS and I will continue to fight to grow this program and expand #EducationFreedom for all students: https://t.co/gKfCfnQq9B https://t.co/VT08EvT6qH
A call to action from a mother in SC who says social isolation is taking a toll on her son who is diagnosed with Down syndrome. "As adults, it is our responsibility to find safe ways to resume an interactive learning environment…and choice must be at the center." #ReOpenSchools https://t.co/B9eCmP48tR
In SC today with Governor @henrymcmaster who knows students need to be able to safely return to school this fall and parents need options to make that happen. Thanks to his leadership, $32M in #CARESAct funds will go to low-income SC families to find the right fit this fall. https://t.co/h9HhciFCbo
Great to be back on the road with @VP as we continue our work across the country to support local leaders as they safely reopen schools in the fall with a focus on doing what's right for students. https://t.co/IxU2AkuTEJ
Reading is foundational to lifelong learning! Thank you @SecretaryCarson for encouraging students to keep reading over the summer and for inviting me to read along with you! https://t.co/666oZyCQRZ
#FindSomethingNew is an innovative @WhiteHouse initiative to connect America's workers to skills-based education opportunities. Whether first entering the workforce or transitioning due to #COVID19, https://t.co/1sRHFhbae4 can connect you to multiple pathways to success.
Five pediatricians interviewed by @NBCNightlyNews agree the benefits of being in school "far outweigh" the risks of #COVID19 for students. All 5 plan to send their kids back to school in the fall. We can reopen schools safely &amp; ensure learning continues. https://t.co/bnRUB1S6vq
Safely reopening schools in the fall must remain our priority. It's the right thing to do for students. It's the right thing to do for families. And, it's the right thing to do for our future. \n\nWATCH: https://t.co/KPYaWC7vYz https://t.co/B8GsTHPGVf
Access to a great education is the launching pad to long-term success. Proud to join @POTUS as he signed this EO establishing the Hispanic Prosperity Initiative which will improve Hispanic Americans' access to educational options &amp; economic opportunities: https://t.co/dEG4rHwNAh
Pleased to host @VP and the @WhiteHouse Coronavirus Task Force at @usedgov today for continued conversation about the need to reopen America's schools. It is not a matter of IF but HOW. All students need to continue learning this fall. https://t.co/RyF4Zt3YOy
Families are demanding that their kids continue to learn this fall. Schools need to reopen and get creative about how to deliver a full school year of learning. Where there's a will, there's a way. Thanks, @TuckerCarlson, for giving a voice to parents who are demanding better. https://t.co/tOEYMdDzoF
"For those of us who are men of color...the effects of false accusations can have highly devastating effects." Joseph is one of many students I met with as we worked to correct the previous #TitleIX regime's failures. Our rule gets this right for everyone. https://t.co/J4NNuocSHs
Absolutely right, @POTUS! Learning must continue for all students. American education must be fully open and fully operational this fall! https://t.co/1tmyfKpj2o
This #IndependenceDay let us celebrate the extraordinary courage of our Founders and the exceptional idea that all Americans were endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Happy #FourthofJuly! https://t.co/vqRGw3TNCo
As we celebrate the 56th anniversary of the #CivilRightsAct, we reflect on the progress &amp; recognize there is still much to be done. Too many students are trapped in a system that fails them. We will not rest until EVERY student can learn in ways that unlock their full potential. https://t.co/ZORWdItToT
We've launched an exciting #RuralTechProject that we hope will spark more innovation for rural students, and all students. This is a challenge for educators to #RethinkSchool and to embrace technology to prepare students for well-paying, in-demand careers: https://t.co/GEK6irGrXq
I am happy to let you know that this morning I was released from Morristown Medical Center. I want to thank the extraordinary doctors &amp; nurses who cared for me for the last week. Thanks to my family &amp; friends for their prayers. I will have more to say about all of this next week.
I am thankful for our hardworking medical professionals and look forward to coming home soon.
In consultation with my doctors, I checked myself into Morristown Medical Center this afternoon. While I am feeling good and only have mild symptoms, due to my history of asthma we decided this is an important precautionary measure.
I just received word that I am positive for COVID-19. I want to thank all of my friends and colleagues who have reached out to ask how I was feeling in the last day or two. I will be receiving medical attention today and will keep the necessary folks apprised of my condition.
I want to thank all who have called and texted in the last few hours to check on my health. I feel fine and have no symptoms. I was last tested for COVID on Tuesday (it was neg) and was tested this morning. No results until tomorrow. I will let you know the results from here.
Getting ready to go on @GMA at 7:15 with @GStephanopoulos to discuss the diagnosis of @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS
Ready to go on ABC with pre-debate coverage. Let's watch together!
The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is truly a tragic loss for her family, the Court and our country. She led an extraordinary life. I had the honor of meeting her and I came to learn that she had a fabulous sense of humor! RIP Justice Ginsburg, you served our country well.
An outstanding dissent by 3rd Circuit Judge Paul Matey. I was proud to have him as my Deputy Chief Counsel! Opposite rulings from the Ninth Circuit and the Third Circuit on gun law show the Roberts Supreme Court can't duck the Second Amendment forever. https://t.co/ZpeYkEsWlA

Losing Tom Seaver tonight is a very sad. I was seven years old in 1969 and Tom Seaver made me a Mets fan. He was the best &amp; most complete pitcher of the last 50 years. He was my hero. My idol is gone &amp; so is a piece of my childhood. RIP Tom Terrific.https://t.co/6CRLO4z6mw

@VP tonight laid out a vision for four more years and a contrast with the future the Biden Democrats promised during the Democratic primary. Good job tonight—he laid the groundwork for the speech by POTUS.
Getting ready to appear with @GStephanopoulos on @GMA to discuss last night's Republican National Convention. Please tune in at 7:10am!

Our Governor taking the side of big business and powerful unions over Main St small business. Now NJ has the second highest unemployment in America! Christie says Murphy's decisions favored big business (over small) and public workers over everything else https://t.co/jEKgW4v02p
As US Attorney I had the joy to work w/Judge Esther Salas when she was a member of the Federal Public Defender's Office. She's a great Judge and an extraordinary person. Mary Pat &amp; I pray for her, her husband Mark and their dear son Daniel. What an unspeakable tragedy and loss.
@D_Jay11 The Godfather or The Godfather Part II. No brainer
The loss of John Lewis represents the passing of not only a political leader but a moral leader. He tried every day to lead by example—not just words, real actions. We obviously didn't often agree politically but that doesn't matter today. He will be missed by me and this nation.
Opioid deaths are up 20% in NJ since the lockdown. Are those lives worth saving? The savings of small businesses are being wiped out. Is that worth saving? NJ unemployment is 2nd highest is the US. And, btw, NJ has 5 times the number of deaths than Georgia https://t.co/I9nwrk0d8x
This is just another example of why Mary Pat and I started https://t.co/JaRqDGMOG5 to help small businesses like this one. State policies are killing these businesses and they may never come back. What will NJ look like then? https://t.co/YQNXnSxLjv
Was very interesting talking to Steve Clemons about the COVID-19 crisis, our NJ30 Day Fund to help small businesses, the 2020 election and the political future of the Republican Party. Hope you will give it a watch! https://t.co/vOrFGVDhF1

The facts in Camden  matter: murders down 81%. Citizen complaints on excessive use of force by police down 95%. We made changes in 2013 NOT to break the union or to deal w/ a fiscal crisis. The story says we spent the SAME amount on policing as before. https://t.co/bSuQFMvms6
