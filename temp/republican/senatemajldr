We don't agree with Speaker Pelosi that "nothing" is better than "something" for workers.\n\nSenators will vote on more relief next week, including more PPP money to stop layoffs. We'll be able to pass it before we turn to Judge Barrett's nomination unless Democrats block it again. https://t.co/paJFhx5HcI
Judge Barrett is just as brilliant and impressive as advertised. She is clearly qualified. She's committed to fairness and impartiality. And she clearly understands the job of a judge under the Constitution is to apply the law and not impose personal policy views.
The far left has been threatening our basic institutions of government since long before this Supreme Court vacancy. When today's Democrats lose one election or one vote on the Senate floor, they start threatening to tear up the rulebook. https://t.co/CT3rnShGZD
Judge Barrett is a stellar nominee. I think the president picked the single best person he could have picked anywhere in the country. This is a woman of extraordinary achievement. https://t.co/E1pyp1PPHU
ICYMI: I joined @marthamaccallum to discuss the Senate's months of success with hybrid hearings, Judge Barrett's outstanding qualifications, and Democrats' refusal to get serious on COVID-19 relief talks. https://t.co/QrBro8587T
The ongoing attacks by Senate Democrats and the media on Judge Barrett's faith are a disgrace. They demean the confirmation process, disrespect the Constitution, and insult millions of American believers. https://t.co/Qg5mFQzWFO
President Trump made an outstanding choice in Judge Amy Coney Barrett. She is one of the finest legal minds of her generation. She's won national admiration for her example of strong female leadership. She's exactly the kind of person Americans deserve on their highest Court. https://t.co/eYEle2s1nw
Judge Barrett's hearings will begin one week from today. Chairman Graham has all the tools to conduct a hybrid hearing, just like the 150 others the Senate has held this year.\n \nWe will not stop working for the American people because Democrats are afraid they may lose a vote.
Democrats say they'll try everything to stall Judge Barrett. The latest excuse: Hybrid hearings with some virtual participation are suddenly bad. \n\nThe Senate has held 150 of these hybrid hearings since May. Democrats have taken advantage of the tools. They've praised the format.
Just had another great call with @POTUS. He sounds well and says he's feeling good. We talked about the people's business — fighting the pandemic, confirming Judge Barrett, and strengthening the economy for American families. Let's keep our President &amp; First Lady in our prayers.
Senate floor proceedings will be postponed until October 19th. The @SenJudiciary confirmation hearings for Judge Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court will convene on October 12th as scheduled by Chairman Graham. My full statement: https://t.co/7ThKZPJBZG
ICYMI: I joined @HughHewitt this morning to discuss Judge Barrett's outstanding qualifications, the decision by some on the left to attack her religious faith, and the Democrats' ongoing threats against our governing institutions. https://t.co/Ze5EbW63qH
Just finished a great phone call with @POTUS. He's in good spirits and we talked business — especially how impressed Senators are with the qualifications of Judge Barrett. Full steam ahead with the fair, thorough, timely process that the nominee, the Court, &amp; the country deserve.
Happy to hear the White House physician's report that @POTUS and @FLOTUS are feeling well following their positive tests for COVID-19. Let's continue to pray today and every day for our President and our First Lady and for all those impacted by COVID-19.
Tune in now to @BretBaier. I'll be discussing Judge Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court and the Democrats' ongoing obstruction of more bipartisan COVID-19 relief.
Everyone who knows Judge Barrett, across the political spectrum, praises her independence and impartiality.\n\nA judge's job is to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIt's revealing how much this basic concept seems to scare the far left.
Democrats want to pack the Supreme Court. Vice President Biden refused to rule it out last night. Now Senate Democrats are demanding promises and pre-commitments from Judge Barrett.\n \nJudicial independence is vital to the rule of law. Why are Republicans alone in defending it?
Judge Barrett is an exemplary judge and a qualified nominee for the Supreme Court. Her legal peers across the political spectrum praise her independence, fair-mindedness, and impartiality. That is exactly what the American people deserve on their highest Court. https://t.co/Eawb6JuCeX
Multiple times, with multiple nominees, Senate Democrats have said or implied that certain personal religious beliefs make Americans unfit to serve. Judge Barrett in 2017 was only one example. Now the media's joining in.\n\nThese tactics need to stop now. https://t.co/wisPUKXe2O
I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Barrett earlier today. President Trump has nominated exactly the kind of outstanding person whom the American people deserve to have on their highest Court. https://t.co/0tTJqPwpeP
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptionally impressive jurist and an exceedingly well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court.\n \nA brilliant scholar. An exemplary judge. President Trump could not have made a better decision. https://t.co/FKadx6TJeU
Tune in: I'm about to join @ShannonBream @foxnewsnight for my first interview on the Supreme Court vacancy. The Senate will do what we did in 2016: Follow history, follow precedent, and do the job we were elected to do.
The far left called John Paul Stevens anti-woman. They said Anthony Kennedy would turn back the clock. David Souter was going to hurt "women, minorities, dissenters, &amp; other groups\" from the bench.\n \nAnyone doubt the same old smears will be rearing their heads starting Saturday?
We don't know which legal all-star the President will nominate on Saturday. So isn't it curious that everyone already knows exactly what smears and scare tactics the far left will trot out?\n \nTheir playbook has not changed for 45 years. The nominee is irrelevant to their attacks.

The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th. There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.
House Democrats' first government funding bill intentionally left rural America behind. But @SenJoniErnst and other Republicans did not let the Democrats defund farm country. They secured the Commodity Credit Corporation funding that our farmers and ranchers depend on.
Yesterday, Sen. Schumer decided to vent his frustration by blocking a bipartisan Intelligence Committee meeting on counterintelligence with a leading expert on protecting our elections.\n\nA partisan temper tantrum is one thing. Jeopardizing national security is a different story.
Rewarding Democrats' tactics now would not stop their attacks on our institutions. Their threats predate this new vacancy by over a year.\n \nTheir recklessness only underscores the importance that we do our job and confirm a nominee who truly respects the Constitution.
Democrats are threatening to attack the foundations of the Senate and the Court if they do not get their way.\n \nHere's the problem with this attempted blackmail: They have already been making these threats for many months. They've been campaigning on them for over a year.
Our Senate majority will do exactly the same thing in 2020 that we did in 2016: Follow Senate history, follow the clear precedent in each situation, and do exactly the job we were elected to do.\n \nWe are going to vote on President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court this year.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a generational legal giant and a trailblazing champion for American women. The Senate is grieving with the nation, praying for her family, and remembering her historic legacy.\n\nMy full Senate floor remarks: https://t.co/mfVTHURqIw
House Democrats' rough draft of a government funding bill shamefully leaves out key relief and support that American farmers need. This is no time to add insult to injury and defund help for farmers and rural America.
The Senate and the nation mourn the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the conclusion of her extraordinary American life.\n\nMy full statement: https://t.co/NOwYLhDxIk
Today we honor National POW/MIA Recognition Day. More than 1300 patriotic Kentuckians still haven't come home. They are not forgotten, and we are still searching.
ICYMI: I joined the @GuyBensonShow to discuss Speaker Pelosi holding up relief for Americans, Senate Democrats' filibuster hypocrisy, and Democrats playing politics with election security. https://t.co/ioFcheGe0P
In 2019, under Republican policies:\n\n- Fastest annual growth in household income on record\n- Working-class &amp; middle-class families saw more of the gains\n- Poverty lowest since 1950s\n \nThat's the leadership our nation will need as we rebuild after COVID. https://t.co/Byrmh3DgD8
It's been less than a year since my bill with Senator Kaine and @SenToddYoung raised the nationwide age for tobacco purchases to 21. We just learned there's already been a major decline in e-cigarette use among young people. Huge bipartisan progress for the health of our kids. https://t.co/yosvf0SA56
Even Speaker Pelosi's own House Democrats are sick of her blocking COVID-19 relief.\n\nBut she insists anything short of her multi-trillion wish list would make Democrats "a cheap date." What a joke.\n\nPeople are hurting. They need help. Not the Speaker's pointless political games.
Today is an historic day for Middle East peace. Landmark agreements formalized at the White House between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain. Thanks to the U.S. and the Trump administration, the winds of change are blowing across toward progress and peace.
The framers designed the Senate to be the country's firewall against bad ideas and radical change. If Democrats are afraid their bad ideas could never meet the bar, it's their proposals that need to be scrapped, not our country's checks and balances.
Great news: Experts have found a huge decline in teen vaping. This is just what we sought with my landmark legislation to increase the required age for all tobacco products to 21. Health officials say that law made a big difference. https://t.co/dqhz6fhQwg
The Trump administration has helped secured two historic peace agreements between Israel and Arab nations in just the last few days. The winds of change are blowing and the Middle East is changing for the better. My full statement: https://t.co/FDbUKWrCpN
Senate Democrats are threatening to blow up the filibuster if they gain power and ram far-left policies through the Senate. But they just used the filibuster last week to block COVID relief. They used it this summer to kill @SenatorTimScott's police reform bill.\n\nTotal hypocrisy.
All military families serve alongside their loved ones in uniform. The new Gold Star Families Memorial in Owensboro, KY commemorates the sacrifices these patriots made in the name of freedom. The nation can never repay our debt. But we can keep these families in our prayers. https://t.co/5bZkjgwqlB
Washington Democrats have now blocked two separate proposals to provide hundreds of billions of dollars for safe schools, jobs, and healthcare. They just do not want American families getting more help before the election. Pure cynicism.
Nineteen years ago, thousands of Americans were murdered by terrorists. National landmarks burned. Brave first responders put their lives on the line to save strangers.\n \nMay we never fail to honor them. And may we never tire of our pledge: Never Again. https://t.co/95QqWlm05m
ICYMI I joined @DanaPerino to discuss Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer's continued efforts to block coronavirus relief funding for Americans. \n \nEvery Senator who voted against relief needs to answer what in the proposal they actually disagreed with. Kids? Jobs? Healthcare? https://t.co/iuGc7fN01A
Every Senate Democrat just voted against hundreds of billions of dollars of COVID-19 relief. They blocked money for schools, testing, vaccines, unemployment insurance, and the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nTheir goal is clear: No help for American families before the election.
Yesterday, reporters asked Sen. Schumer whether by refusing to compromise, he was making the perfect the enemy of the good. His response? "Republicans are the enemy of the good."\n\nAmericans are not enemies. COVID-19 is our enemy. It's time for Washington Democrats to act like it.
The Senate is voting today on COVID-19 relief. Hundreds of billions more dollars to make schools safe for kids, to keep workers getting paid, and to invest in treatments and vaccines.\n\nAmerican families will see exactly which Senators want to send them more bipartisan help.
Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer were attacking our new COVID proposal before they'd even read it.\n\nThey're attacking it over provisions that literally have Democrat cosponsors.\n\nThey just don't want Americans getting another cent of bipartisan relief before the November election.
The coronavirus doesn't care about our election. But it's clear that's all Democrats care about. Look at the facts and ask each Democrat what in the proposal that we're voting on tomorrow they actually disagree with. \n\nMore historic funding for schools? Jobs? Healthcare? https://t.co/p38BQjgvKM
This year's Kentucky Derby showed our great traditions can adapt to overcome any challenge. But our sport must be protected. \n\nI've been proud to stand up for horseracing throughout my career. Today, I'm introducing new legislation to keep up that support. https://t.co/3sU5juOUCI
Republicans will not let Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer kill COVID relief behind closed doors without putting every Senator on the record.\n\nTomorrow, we'll vote to protect workers' paychecks, keep kids safe in school, and win the healthcare fight against the virus.
Republicans have built yet another effort to help Americans. Money for schools. Resources for parents. Testing. Vaccines. Another round of the job-saving PPP. And more.\n\nThe Senate will be voting this week. The nation will see who's serious about making law for American families.
Democrats have blocked any new COVID relief, saying anything short of their entire far-left wish list is "piecemeal" and "emaciated."\n \nThe same Democrats rushed back to D.C. to pass piecemeal legislation for the Postal Service that did nothing at all for working families.
Republicans have spent months fighting for more COVID-19 relief. We proposed a major $1T bill. Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer said no. We suggested smaller bipartisan deals. They said no again.\n \nToday we put forward yet another proposal. They attacked it before even reading it.
Republicans and Democrats have big differences, but they should not stop us from agreeing where we can and making law to help Americans through this crisis. Working families cannot suffer more because Democrats think their pain helps them politically. The Senate is going to vote. https://t.co/HzbPxvRe9I
But Republicans are not done fighting for the American people. Today our majority is introducing a targeted proposal for kids, jobs, and healthcare to help with many of our most urgent challenges. No more obstruction behind closed doors. Every Senator will be going on the record. https://t.co/N7QdjXrQql
Senate Republicans have been trying for months to deliver more COVID-19 relief to American families. Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer have blocked us at every turn. Every action has suggested they simply do not want families to get any more bipartisan help before the election. https://t.co/nEPUDXBzIt
As Kentuckians, Thoroughbred racing is practically in our bones. It's who we are. We find our state's unique history on the track &amp; in the stables.

From homegrown hemp masks to distilleries making hand sanitizer, Kentuckians are leading by example. We're going to keep working together to beat this virus. https://t.co/ll44Cdk9k5
Republicans are committed to making sure the Postal Service remains well equipped to fulfill its important duties. But the Senate will not pass stand-alone legislation for the Postal Service while American families continue to go without the help they need.
If Washington Democrats would devote half the energy they spend worrying about their own re-elections to actually helping the American people, we could easily achieve the kind of targeted, bipartisan relief package that Republicans have wanted for weeks.
House Democrats have spent weeks ignoring the urgent needs of American workers and families, but they rushed back to Washington the instant that overblown conspiracy theories about the U.S. Postal Service convinced them their own jobs might be in jeopardy. My full statement: https://t.co/41VdckTLw0

Democrats' latest spin: They've moved from a $3.5 trillion, far-left, non-COVID-related wish list to a $2.5 trillion, far-left, non-COVID-related wish list and insist the White House meet them there.\n\nThat's not a reality-based negotiation. It's throwing spaghetti at the wall. https://t.co/QmHTA0WdMu
President Trump deserves great credit for bringing about this historic step forward for the Middle East. The commitment to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates represents tremendous progress toward greater peace and prosperity across the region. https://t.co/uFTatL2xDa
The PPP saved Main Street jobs across Kentucky. It sent more than $5B in payroll support to our state. But the recovery is not finished. Hard-hit businesses need a second draw, and Republicans proposed one.\n\nBut Democrats are blocking it over non-COVID-related wish-list items.
Americans need relief, and that means focusing on what's directly related to COVID-19: Kids, jobs, healthcare, and legal protections for re-opening.\n\nI applaud the President for taking action during this emergency to get help to Americans who are struggling. https://t.co/5xatB6FalX
The Speaker &amp; Democratic Leader say not another dime for testing, treatments, or vaccines unless they get a huge tax cut for blue-state millionaires.\n \nTaking our health system hostage over longtime, non-COVID-related, liberal demands.\n \nThis is a crisis. Let's govern like it.
Tune in now to @FoxNews: I'm joining @BillHemmer to discuss Democrats' decision to play hardball with vulnerable Americans who need help and hurt our nation's chance to get on offense against the virus.
The Speaker and the Democratic Leader say they won't allow another cent for families, schools, or the PPP unless they get a trillion-dollar state government slush fund, way beyond COVID needs.\n \nThese unrelated liberal demands are blocking billions in aid that families need now.
The New York Times proclaims Democrats are "Playing Hardball on Coronavirus Relief."\n \n"Playing" is right — they're treating this like a political game.\n \nFamilies are suffering. Americans are dying. This isn't a game, it's a crisis. Our country needs Democrats to act like it.
Because of Democrats' obstruction, the extra federal unemployment aid expired. The PPP is closed with no second round in sight. No new money for testing or schools. No second round of checks to families. Democrats held all this hostage for non-COVID-related liberal priorities.
I hoped this week we'd be finalizing major legislation. After all, American families are struggling and need help. But Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer decided not to deliver. I am glad the president stepped in to soften the blow of their hostage tactics.
Struggling Americans need action now. I am glad that President Trump is proving that while Democrats use laid-off workers as political pawns, Republicans will actually look out for them. My full statement: https://t.co/5uEu6PSUGH

ICYMI, I joined @FoxNews to discuss Democrats' obstruction of the COVID-19 relief negotiations, how Republicans tried to keep extra unemployment benefits from expiring, and the need to keep small-business aid flowing. https://t.co/rwGyAXgzIB
Democrats' obstruction last week forced the additional federal unemployment benefit to expire. Their obstruction this week will force another deadline: the PPP shuts its doors Saturday. Republicans had plans to keep both from expiring. Democrats have refused them all.

We need to urgently help working families and those who've lost their jobs. But the Speaker and the Democratic Leader are blocking the entire rescue package over a special, unrelated tax cut for rich people in high-tax blue states.
Speaker Pelosi is still holding up this entire package over bizarre unrelated things like carveouts for the marijuana industry. She even claimed to the press that pot is a proven COVID-19 therapy!\n \nI hope she's shared this breakthrough with Dr. Fauci.\n \nCan we get serious yet? https://t.co/CksSWrMKDN

Republicans tried several ways to extend unemployment benefits. Democrats blocked them all. They're refusing any more COVID relief for anyone unless they get a massive tax cut for rich people in blue states.\n\nThe country can't afford this cynicism. Americans need help now.

Democrats are holding up urgent help for struggling people over completely unrelated liberal wish-list items, like massive tax cuts for rich people in blue states. Economists across the spectrum say it's a terrible idea. This is how serious they are about these negotiations.
ICYMI: I joined @JudyWoodruff on @NewsHour to discuss the importance of helping schools and employers safely reopen, and delivering new relief to working families in need. For the country's sake, Democrats need to come to the table. https://t.co/iTB5o9iHm9
Senate Republicans tried several ways to extend the expiring unemployment assistance. Democrats blocked them all and refused another dime for COVID-19 relief unless they get to pass a bill that includes an unrelated tax cut for rich people in blue states. https://t.co/Vl4krLjMIr
There's a fact of life here in the United States Senate: It takes 60 votes to legislate. So the American people cannot get any of the additional relief that Republicans want to give them unless Democrats will come to the table.
The coronavirus does not care that we are divided. The coronavirus will not care if Washington Democrats decide it suits their partisan goals to let relief run dry.\n\nThe American people are hurting and Congress should have their backs.
The historic CARES Act has helped families endure this crisis. But our nation is not done with this fight. More Americans are dying. Millions are unemployed. Added federal unemployment benefits are close to expiring.\n\nDemocrats need to get serious and come to the table.
I joined @CNBC to discuss Senate Republican's HEALS Act. \n\nThe pandemic is not finished. The economic pain is not finished. So Congress cannot be finished either. Republicans are ready to govern. We just need Democrats to decide whether they are serious about making law. https://t.co/aM30wub8rT
Tune in now to @CNBC. I am joining @kaylatausche ~3:05 PM ET to discuss Senate Republicans' HEALS Act — our framework for another round of historic relief to American workers and families.
Our Democratic colleagues want to pretend it is controversial that taxpayers should not pay people more not to work than the people who do go back to work. The American people don't call that a controversy. They call that common sense. They call that basic fairness. https://t.co/8N7s4ySlV4
Our nation stands at a challenging crossroads. We have one foot in this pandemic and one foot in the recovery. What the American people need is a smart, safe, and sustainable middle ground. \n \nThey need Congress's help to construct it. That's exactly what the HEALS Act would do.
Republicans have created a serious framework. The question is whether Democrats will come to the table in good faith. In March, when they did, we passed the CARES Act unanimously. In June, when they didn't, police reform collapsed.\n\nIt will take bipartisanship to make law.
We have produced a tailored and targeted bill that will address each of the three distinct crises facing our country: Getting kids back in school, getting workers back to work, and winning the healthcare fight against the virus.\nKids, jobs, and healthcare.
COVID-19 has killed nearly 150,000 Americans. 17 million people are out of work. The virus is still with us and the American people need more help. That is why Senate Republicans are introducing a new comprehensive rescue package today: https://t.co/OKqk1ZyA2D
This terrible virus is still with us and America's fight continues. Across the country, by taking commonsense steps – like wearing a mask and practicing social distancing – we'll get through this together. https://t.co/0BRIa8bw13
The CARES Act provided Kentucky and our nation with the tools to endure the first phase of the coronavirus crisis. But America's fight continues, so Congress's support for our people must continue as well. CARES 2 will focus on three things: Kids, jobs, and healthcare. https://t.co/l70w1h7jF0
The Senate majority has assembled a framework for CARES 2. It is tailored precisely to this phase of the crisis to deliver more relief to the American people. It represents an agreement in principle with the administration, and will be introduced next week.
Our nation stands at a critical midway point in our fight against the coronavirus. Far too many families are continuing to face serious healthcare and economic challenges. So Congress' support for our people must continue as well.

At the outset of this crisis, the Senate wrote and passed the historic, bipartisan CARES Act. It helped pull our health system and economy back from the brink. But this crisis is far from over. The American people still need help. So the Senate must act again.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. famously said "the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice." Our nation has bent toward justice because heroes like John Lewis took it upon themselves to lead the way. We celebrate the life of this American hero. https://t.co/uyy3rOOn1U

The Speaker has chosen to spend the House's time this week on a cousin of the Green New Deal masquerading as a highway bill. \n\nIt will go nowhere in the Senate. Here, we'll keep at the serious work of the nation. https://t.co/kIokDxtLwD
TUNE IN: I will be joining @DanaPerino ~2:40pm ET to discuss Senate Republicans' accomplishments and our work on coronavirus relief.
