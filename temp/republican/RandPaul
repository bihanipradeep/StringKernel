Those of you who want to stand up and fight the socialists poisoning our schools and burning our cities — join me in supporting President Trump.
So to our soldiers and their families – join me in supporting President Trump. \n\nThose of you who want lower taxes and better, less expensive healthcare, join me in supporting President Trump.
If you hate war like I hate war…if you want us to quit sending $50 billion to Afghanistan for luxury hotels and natural gas to stations…you need to support President Trump for another term!
I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported wars in Serbia, Syria, and Libya. Joe Biden will continue to spill our blood and treasure. President Trump will bring our heroes home.
Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War, which President Trump has long called our generation's worst geopolitical mistake.
I'm proud to see a President who agrees with that finally. \n\n Compare President Trump with the disastrous record of Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, who consistently called for more war.
President Trump is the first President in a generation to seek to end war rather than start one. He intends to end the war in Afghanistan. He is bringing our men and women home. \n\n Madison once wrote, \"No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.\"
I flew with him to Dover Air Force Base to honor two soldiers whose remains were coming home from Afghanistan. I will never forget that night. I can tell you the President not only felt the pain of these families but is committed to ending this war.
I'm supporting President Trump because he believes as I do that a strong America cannot fight endless wars. \n\nWe must not continue to leave our blood and treasure in Middle East quagmires.
While others talked about criminal justice reform, President Trump signed the First Step Act, the first real reform in a generation, and one that sought to undo the harm that others, like Joe Biden, have done.
I brought President Trump an idea for better, cheaper health insurance called Association Health Plans. Donald Trump overturned years of red tape and bureaucrats and made it happen.
When some in Congress wanted a so-called \"revenue neutral\" tax plan, Donald Trump and I worked together to make sure it was a real tax cut.
But more important than simple agreements are accomplishments. \n\nPresident Donald Trump gets things done.
I'm proud of the job Donald Trump has done as President. \n\nI don't always agree with him. But our occasional policy differences are far outweighed by our significant agreements.
A few years later, we were opponents, both running for President. \n\nWe all know how that turned out.
We performed hundreds of surgeries in both countries. Nothing is more beautiful to me in this world than removing the bandages from a person's eyes and watching them as they see their loved ones again. Donald Trump helped me make that happen.
Not only did he support my medical mission to Guatemala, but he also contributed to another mission trip to Haiti a year later.
I was planning a medical mission to Guatemala to perform charity eye surgeries. We needed money to fund the trip.  Donald Trump offered to help and immediately came through for those kids and us.
