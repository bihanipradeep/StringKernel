Just more corrupt Fake News trying to change the course of our most important, ever, Election!
1,Biggest & Fastest Financial Recovery In History. Next year will be BEST EVER, unless a very Sleepy person becomes President and massively raises your taxes - In which case, CRASH!
1,Just heard that Wacko John Bolton was talking of the fact that I discussed “love letters from Kim Jong Un” as though I viewed them as just that. Obviously, was just being sarcastic. Bolton was such a jerk!
1,Rochester N.Y., Brooklyn N.Y., Portland - All had bad nights, all weakly run by Radical Left Democrat Governors and Mayors! Get the picture?

Of course they want Biden. I have taken $Billions from China and given it to our Farmers and U.S. Treasury. China would own the U.S. if Biden &amp; Hunter got in!
1,Will be having a Labor Day News Conference today at the White House, 1:00 P.M. Jobs number, and the Economic comeback, are looking GREAT. Happy Labor Day!
1,Starting to get VERY high marks in our handling of the Coronavirus (China Virus), especially when compared to other countries and areas of the world. Now the Vaccines (Plus) are coming, and fast!
1,A massive Disinformation Campaign is going on by the Democrats, their partner, the Fake News Media, & Big Tech. They create false stories and then push them like has never been done before, even beyond the 2016 Campaign. It imperils our Country, and must stop now. Victory 2020!
1,Our Economy and Jobs are doing really well. Next Year will be a Record Setter. Stay Tuned!
1,Big Ten Football is looking really good, but may lose Michigan, Illinois, and Maryland because of those Governors’ ridiculous lack of interest or political support. They will play without them?
0,It's not enough to just thank our essential workers — we need to pay them. As president, I’ll: - Raise the minimum wage to $15 - End the tipped minimum wage - End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities - Ensure everyone has strong benefits
0,For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions. It will end on my watch. I'll sign the PRO Act — making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain — and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.
0,Today, we honor the generations of union workers who fought for the rights, power, wages, and benefits that built and sustained the great American middle class. #LaborDay
0,Time and again, the president has refused to provide Puerto Rico with much-needed resources. He’s repeatedly insulted Puerto Ricans and this latest action is another example of his disrespect for the island. This ends when I’m elected president.
0,We all want our schools to reopen — but we need to do it in a way that puts the health and safety of our students and educators first. Here's how @KamalaHarris and I will reopen our schools safely and effectively:
0,The economy wasn’t working for folks long before this virus hit. That’s why @KamalaHarris and I won’t just build back to the way things were — we’re going to build back better. We’re going to make sure everyone has a fair shot to get ahead.
0,As president, I will: - Call for nationwide mask mandates - Implement widespread testing - Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines I’m ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track.
0,Nicaraguan asylum seekers fleeing oppression deserve to have their cases heard. Instead, they’re being deported back into the tyrannical grip of Daniel Ortega without a chance to pursue their claims. President Trump’s cruelty truly knows no bounds.
0,Mr. President, enough with the weekend golf trips and erratic tweets. It's time for you to get to work and control the spread of this virus.
0,Every day Donald Trump proves how morally unfit he is to lead our nation. In 60 days, we have to vote him out.0,It's not enough to just thank our essential workers — we need to pay them. As president, I’ll: - Raise the minimum wage to $15 - End the tipped minimum wage - End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities - Ensure everyone has strong benefits
