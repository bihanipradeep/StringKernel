Last night reinforced why I got into this race: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation - and it's a battle we must win.

Ignore the polls, ignore his tweets, ignore his obnoxious debate performance. We have to stay focused. We have to win. Chip in to help us do it: https://t.co/qTfNFIRY9Y
Donald Trump showed the country last night just how unfit he is to be president. If you weren't able to bear watching it, we condensed it down to one minute for you: https://t.co/uopjSrldzn
I took the Amtrak from Wilmington to Washington, D.C., every day for 36 years. The journey became routine, but the hardworking men and women I met along the way became dear friends. https://t.co/kyikjGKFQ9
Enough with the racist dog whistles, Donald. You wouldn't know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn. https://t.co/jodPtc0YDE

One month until we can call @DrBiden our First Lady-Elect. https://t.co/Yi6wxsonYP
It's time we come together. It's time we see each other as fellow Americans, who don't just live in red states and blue states, but who live in - and love - the United States of America. That's who we are - and there is nothing we cannot do if we do it together.
One month until Election Day. Let's do this, America.
Be a patriot. Do your part. Wearing a mask will protect you. But it will also protect those around you - your mom, your dad, your son, your daughter, your neighbor, your co-worker. Don't just do it for yourself. Do it for the people you love.
We have to come together. https://t.co/P8SkE6vkX1
Thank you, Grand Rapids, for a great afternoon. From the virus to the economy, we face immense challenges as a nation. But if we come together and act as one America, we can and will overcome them. https://t.co/eY5FVKRv3K
I'm running as a Democrat, but I will be an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you.
We can, we will, and we must come together.
This cannot be a partisan moment. It must be an American moment. We have to come together as a nation.
I'm delivering remarks from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Tune in. https://t.co/LhZJjc4wIb

I'm happy to report that Jill and I have tested negative for COVID. Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern. I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.
Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.
Donald Trump will do everything he can to distract from the fact that because of his failed COVID-19 response: - Over 200,000 Americans have died - 26 million are on unemployment - 1 in 6 small businesses risk permanent closure We can't let him.
When I first ran for Senate, we put up a billboard that said, “Joe Biden: For all our families.” It's a motto that has guided me throughout my career. It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or Republican-I'll be a president for all Americans, not just the ones who vote for me.
On Native Women's Equal Pay Day, we recognize the hard truth that Native women earn just $0.57 for every dollar a white man makes. It's unacceptable. A Biden-Harris Administration will stand with women in Indian Country and pass legislation to close the gender wage gap. https://t.co/RstWRwFc2J
During Filipino American History Month, we celebrate the community's immense contributions to our country - from early immigrants to the millions today, many who serve in the military or as frontline workers. As President, I'll work alongside them to protect the American people.
Three years ago today, Las Vegas was struck by tragedy when a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. As we remember those we lost, we must take action to ensure it never happens again.
Jill and I wish a happy Mid-Autumn Festival to all those celebrating. We join you in hoping for a future filled with peace and prosperity - and hope your festivities lead to a bountiful harvest in the year ahead.
Jill and I want to wish a very happy birthday to President Carter –– a patriot, a humanitarian, and a friend. Thank you for your tireless dedication to our country and to the world. https://t.co/SrajBmltek
On behalf of Jill and our entire family, I want to wish the Korean-American community a happy Chuseok. May your celebrations be filled with laughter, joy, and plenty of good food. 행복한 한가위 보내세요!
I paid my taxes. These folks paid their taxes. So why didn't President Trump pay his? https://t.co/gcRWGnWF57
You determine the outcome of this election - not Donald Trump. Vote: https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
It's safe to say I've gotten to know the hardworking men and women of @Amtrak over the years - I'm proud to stand with them as they face furloughs due to funding cuts. These essential workers have kept us moving during this pandemic –– now it's time we have their backs. https://t.co/aoaTYZdhoF
Last night, I went toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and laid out my vision for a stronger, more inclusive America. Check out a few of the top moments from the first debate: https://t.co/H1WFQIxU6y

Had enough? https://t.co/4W5OSoRzXI
There's no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night. https://t.co/Q3VZTW1vUV
Folks, we don't have to put up with four more years of that. https://t.co/aIt2BNuQg3
