Last night reinforced why I got into this race: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and it's a battle we must win.

I took the Amtrak from Wilmington to Washington, D.C., every day for 36 years. The journey became routine, but the hardworking men and women I met along the way became dear friends. https://t.co/kyikjGKFQ9

One month until we can call @DrBiden our First Lady-Elect. https://t.co/Yi6wxsonYP
It's time we come together. It's time we see each other as fellow Americans, who don't just live in red states and blue states, but who live in — and love — the United States of America. That's who we are — and there is nothing we cannot do if we do it together.
One month until Election Day. Let's do this, America.
Be a patriot. Do your part. Wearing a mask will protect you. But it will also protect those around you — your mom, your dad, your son, your daughter, your neighbor, your co-worker. Don't just do it for yourself. Do it for the people you love.
We have to come together. https://t.co/P8SkE6vkX1
Thank you, Grand Rapids, for a great afternoon. From the virus to the economy, we face immense challenges as a nation. But if we come together and act as one America, we can and will overcome them. https://t.co/eY5FVKRv3K
I'm running as a Democrat, but I will be an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you.
We can, we will, and we must come together.
This cannot be a partisan moment. It must be an American moment. We have to come together as a nation.

I'm happy to report that Jill and I have tested negative for COVID. Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern. I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.
Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.
Donald Trump will do everything he can to distract from the fact that because of his failed COVID-19 response: - Over 200,000 Americans have died - 26 million are on unemployment - 1 in 6 small businesses risk permanent closure We can't let him.
When I first ran for Senate, we put up a billboard that said, "Joe Biden: For all our families." It's a motto that has guided me throughout my career. It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or Republican—I'll be a president for all Americans, not just the ones who vote for me.
On Native Women's Equal Pay Day, we recognize the hard truth that Native women earn just $0.57 for every dollar a white man makes. It's unacceptable. A Biden-Harris Administration will stand with women in Indian Country and pass legislation to close the gender wage gap. https://t.co/RstWRwFc2J
During Filipino American History Month, we celebrate the community's immense contributions to our country — from early immigrants to the millions today, many who serve in the military or as frontline workers. As President, I'll work alongside them to protect the American people.
Three years ago today, Las Vegas was struck by tragedy when a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. As we remember those we lost, we must take action to ensure it never happens again.
Jill and I wish a happy Mid-Autumn Festival to all those celebrating. We join you in hoping for a future filled with peace and prosperity — and hope your festivities lead to a bountiful harvest in the year ahead.
Jill and I want to wish a very happy birthday to President Carter –– a patriot, a humanitarian, and a friend. Thank you for your tireless dedication to our country and to the world. https://t.co/SrajBmltek
On behalf of Jill and our entire family, I want to wish the Korean-American community a happy Chuseok. May your celebrations be filled with laughter, joy, and plenty of good food. 행복한 한가위 보내세요!

It's safe to say I've gotten to know the hardworking men and women of @Amtrak over the years — I'm proud to stand with them as they face furloughs due to funding cuts. These essential workers have kept us moving during this pandemic –– now it's time we have their backs. https://t.co/aoaTYZdhoF

Folks, we don't have to put up with four more years of that. https://t.co/aIt2BNuQg3
You have it in your control to determine what this country's gonna look like the next four years. Is it going to change –– or are you going to get four more years of these lies? https://t.co/eoxT07uII9

You determine the outcome of this election. Vote. Vote. Vote. https://t.co/Ros3XuU16k
Under this president, we have become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession, I was asked to fix it, and I did. We left Donald Trump a booming economy, and he caused a recession. https://t.co/uEMPaTtZ7F
Go to: https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
Under this president, we've become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent.
Beau Biden was not a loser. https://t.co/hwzlZrjh75
Donald Trump isn't a law and order president. He's a president who breaks the law and creates disorder.
Donald Trump talks a lot about the art of the deal. But under his watch, China has perfected the art of the steal. https://t.co/OSTsHHTtBQ
More jobs were created in the final three years of the Obama-Biden Administration than in the first three years of Donald Trump's presidency. A million and a half more jobs. https://t.co/3Y75JhJY0n
On average, roughly 750 to 1,000 Americans are dying from COVID every day. When Donald Trump was presented with that number, he said, "It is what it is." It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is. https://t.co/OOm2pVRijz
Show us your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump.
Donald Trump is the worst president we've ever had.
When I hear 200,000 deaths, I think of the empty chairs at dining room tables all across the country, which just months ago were filled by loved ones. It didn't have to be this bad.
It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is.
The American people deserve to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. https://t.co/jnFXiDkt2c
President Trump keeps promising to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he's in Court trying to rip their protections away. And now, he's trying to jam through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him get it done. We can't let him win.
I'm about to step on stage to debate Donald Trump for the first time. But before I do, can you chip in to show him the power of our grassroots base? Every donation — big or small — goes a long way. https://t.co/HiNSLIqIPQ

If we're elected, @KamalaHarris and I will wake up every single morning to fight for the middle class. For Main Street. For the folks who keep our country running. We're going to make our government work for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
You deserve a president who tells you the truth. https://t.co/YcIMDYZr66
It's grassroots donors like you who power our campaign. And I'm counting on you to help us meet our end-of-quarter fundraising goal. If you're able, please chip in before tomorrow night's big deadline: https://t.co/JDpr6U0evX
The American people deserve transparency from their leaders, it's why as of today, I've released 22 years of my tax returns. https://t.co/6fwL20fWeI
With casualties rapidly mounting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, the Trump Administration needs to call the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan immediately to de-escalate the situation. It must also demand others — like Turkey — stay out of this conflict. https://t.co/C41YKEGTyA
The American people understand the urgency of this moment. They're voting in droves because their health care hangs in the balance. But Donald Trump doesn't care — he sees a chance to eliminate Obamacare and rip away health care protections from millions. It's unconscionable.
I believe there's no greater economic engine in the world than the hard work and ingenuity of the American people — and I witnessed it firsthand last week in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Together, we're going to make sure the future is made here in America. https://t.co/tw7tv6sPKT
Folks, this is a big week for our campaign: Tomorrow, I face Donald Trump on the debate stage for the first time — and Wednesday is our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline. We can't afford to fall short here. Chip in today: https://t.co/PBlWnV8pBr

I'm not looking to punish anyone, but it's about time the super-wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share.
Whether it's $7.50, $75, or $750 — every donation makes a big difference during this final stretch. Chip in to help us get Donald Trump out of the White House: https://t.co/ttsZXljWG1
President Trump can claim he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions all he wants — but the fact is he's fighting tooth and nail to take their protections away.
How much more did you pay in taxes than President Trump? Head to https://t.co/h9ZZ0iBuiE to find out. https://t.co/w689uVoHq7
Here's the deal: Until we deal with COVID-19, we'll never get our economy fully back on track, get our kids safely back to school, or get our lives back. It's why as president, I won't waste a day getting this virus under control. https://t.co/xjxsDmKPe3
There's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the Supreme Court. President Trump and Republicans have been trying to throw out Obamacare for years — and now they see an opening to get it done. We can't let them get away with it.
On this Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, Jill and I are keeping the loved ones of our fallen heroes in our prayers. May we never fail to honor them and carry their spirit with us every day.
Jill, Kamala, Doug, and our families all extend our warmest wishes to all who observe Yom Kippur. May you have an easy and meaningful fast. And may you be sealed in the Book of Life. https://t.co/z4EMRDH8Y5
The truth is the economy wasn't working for folks long before these crises hit. It's why @KamalaHarris and I won't just build back to the way things were — we'll build back better. We won't be satisfied until the economy starts working for everyone.
The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court affect our everyday lives — and the American people deserve to have their voices heard when it comes to who serves on the Court. Tune in as I deliver remarks on President Trump's nomination. https://t.co/N9HmjDXKMw
These folks know that we can't saddle this country with four more years of Donald Trump. https://t.co/6a3GAHCPyC
Thank you @TheRock for your support at this critical moment for our nation. You said it best: This election is about earning the respect of the American people. It's about decency. It's about electing leaders who tell the truth. Thanks again, DJ. Next time we're talking cars. https://t.co/V5kHR5fQbe
In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump is trying to force through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him destroy Obamacare. Health care is at stake. Protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake. We can't let them win. https://t.co/zIdPmxzYtQ
The Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do.
Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions. The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress. Americans deserve to be heard.
Today, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court — a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court's decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. Vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is. https://t.co/TDBQOVLP4K
When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus. After COVID-19 hit, President Trump lied to the American people and said it would miraculously "disappear. " ow, over 200,000 lives have been cut short. It's a national tragedy.
At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change. We need a president who believes in science.
Today is Public Lands Day and National Hunting and Fishing Day — and what better way to celebrate than the long overdue removal of William Perry Pendley from @blmnational. It's a victory for everyone who values our public lands over those who want to exploit them for profit. https://t.co/lZxDF4PzH6
If I'm elected, I won't wait to take action on COVID-19. Minutes after the race is called, I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. During my transition, I'll bring together experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward. We will overcome this, together.
Thanks for a great trip, Minnesota! Don't forget that early voting is now open across the state. Head to https://t.co/7PghlU2FSm to make your plan to vote today. https://t.co/xRLkPOGwcr
Today, Justice Ginsburg made history one last time — and I was grateful to be there to pay my respects. May her memory be a blessing — and may we continue to be voices for justice in her name. https://t.co/TMJeYw0d89
The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us. It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating. It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office — to care, for everyone.
We are in the middle of a climate emergency — and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet. We have to vote him out. https://t.co/NkSJ7bvBoE
Obamacare was—and is—a big deal. As president, I'll protect and build on it, lower health care costs, and give Americans the opportunity to choose a new public option. We're going to make sure everyone has access to the affordable health care they need. https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
Health care is a right — not a privilege.
In the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. Don't forget that.
Thank you, @CindyMcCain. Your support and your friendship mean the world to me. John and I didn't always agree on the issues, but we put aside our differences to find common ground and move the country forward — it's what I'll do every day as president. https://t.co/KheAlsKt73
I've spent my career working to end violence against women and will fight to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. I applaud Congress for passing Savanna's Act this week. ow, the Senate and President Trump need to reauthorize VAWA. It's long overdue. https://t.co/Xru7YzAUBD
Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better.
The Trump Administration says "the entire ACA must fall. " They are arguing to strip millions of Americans of health care in the middle of a pandemic. We can't let him win. https://t.co/bcwiGz1HOn
In-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. The Flint, MI City Clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before Election Day for folks to cast their ballots. It's an example that cities and states across the country should follow.

Even amidst the profound grief  anger today's decision generated, violence is never  can never be the answer. Those who engage in it must be held accountable. Jill  I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift  full recovery.
The 200,000 people we've lost to COVID-19 weren't nobodies, Mr. President. They were our parents and grandparents, sons and daughters, friends and co-workers. They were Americans. https://t.co/EcdaEiwgUS

Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue. I see the world from where I grew up: Scranton, Pennsylvania.
It didn't have to be this bad. https://t.co/R2WqNeauiu
200,000 Americans have died from this virus. It's a staggering number that's hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same. There's a devastating human toll to this pandemic — and we can't forget that.
While other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing. ow, nearly 200,000 Americans have died. It didn't have to happen this way. https://t.co/RqdLtARlRW
Today, we'll pass another grim milestone in this pandemic: 200,000 American lives lost. Jill and I are keeping everyone who's hurting in our prayers. No words can numb your pain, but know the nation grieves with you. Today is dark, but we will overcome this. Keep the faith.
Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country — and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.
When the virus came, President Trump wasn't thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection. It's how Trump looks at the world: It's always about him, never about us. You deserve a president who will put you first.

Honor and decency are on the ballot this November. https://t.co/pWmWySJAs5
It was my honor to preside over Justice Ginsburg's confirmation hearings, and to support her accession to the Supreme Court. Her opinions, and her dissents, will shape the basis of our law for generations to come — and we'll be a more just and equal nation because of it. https://t.co/SmZD2KyyyG
I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message. https://t.co/TuRZXPE5xK
We must win.
The Supreme Court is on the ballot. And the outcome will impact everything from health care to civil rights — affecting generations to come. Vote. Our future depends on it. https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for all of us. She was a giant of the Court and unflinching in her pursuit of equal justice under the law. Because of her life's work, we are closer to that more perfect union we've always strived to be. https://t.co/o30ZCuj10G
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us all. https://t.co/vQQiB1oQ2J
Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise.
Jill and I wish our friends in the Jewish community a very healthy and happy New Year. As we mark this new beginning, let us commit to pursuing peace and justice in the year ahead. #RoshHashanah

I can't believe I have to say this, but if I'm elected president, I won't put a climate change denier — one who called the scientific community "a bunch of thugs " — in charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. https://t.co/FcRtv8ZcYS
When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us. When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing. When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found. It's unforgivable.
Donald Trump claimed he would be "the greatest jobs president God ever created. " But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history. We can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. https://t.co/uW10KJhMsV

Donald Trump wants to give his rich friends another tax cut, so they pay a lower tax rate than tens of millions of essential workers and middle class Americans. We need a president who cares about more than the wealthy and well-connected.

The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis. ow, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break. Let that sink in.
If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president. The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families. We're going to reward work — not wealth.
.@realDonaldTrump, the job is to be president of all Americans. For the love of God start acting like it. https://t.co/kkHf9aWZmR
We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing. We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine. The stakes are too high.

For four years, President Trump has tried to crush the Affordable Care Act. With his Supreme Court nominee, he is threatening the destruction of every benefit and protection of the ACA, including life-saving protections for 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.

That's why the House passed the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act this summer. We owe it to Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Philando Castile and so many others to finally bring an end to police brutality.
Breonna Taylor should be alive today. She should be living and laughing and loving. Instead, her family is left continuing the search for justice. Today's charging decision holds no one accountable for her death.

President Trump's contempt for science, governance &amp; the American people's health has led to an historic national tragedy. Republicans must accept the gravity of this crisis &amp; vote on the science-based strategy in the #HeroesAct, which passed the House more than four months ago.
More than 200,000 men, women and children have lost their lives to this coronavirus in the United States.\n\nOur hearts break for them and their loved ones.\n\nThe pain is made worse by the simple fact that it didn't have to be this way.
Read my full statement here: https://t.co/I8tekH9IvQ
Nearly 200,000 Americans have died. Almost seven million Americans have been infected. The sudden removal of CDC guidelines on airborne coronavirus spread is the latest sign of the Trump Admin's broken response to this crisis, which continues to cost American lives.

Few know more about our education system than @BobbyScott. When he says schools won't be able to protect students, staff &amp; families w/o significant federal funding, it must be taken seriously. The @SenateGOP must work with us to deliver for communities nationwide. #HeroesAct https://t.co/hFrRNoim6K
President Trump's insulting comments about our men and women in uniform are appalling. Our military deserves a Commander-in-Chief who respects their service. Clearly, Trump does not. https://t.co/my8NosRXtB https://t.co/NqHLie2cuQ
With millions still unemployed, particularly in communities of color, the #JobsReport is a reminder of the urgent need to enact the #HeroesAct, as the economic recovery stimulated by Congress's early &amp; robust investments continues to slow down. https://t.co/s6zFa8dssx
The Trump Admin's politically motivated efforts to rush the #Census count are a threat to reach an accurate count. Read my letter with @SenSchumer calling for full disclosure of the Admin's decision-making process here: https://t.co/4wkovuDwfG

Just when frontline workers nationwide most need Washington to work for them, Republicans are still refusing to accept the gravity of this crisis. The White House and Republican Senate need to get serious and work with Democrats to #FundTheFrontLines.
It has been 111 days since the House passed the #HeroesAct, and still Republicans in the Senate remain determined to block this plan to help America's working families. Enough is enough. The Senate must put #FamiliesFirst and finally pass the Heroes Act. https://t.co/VVQgGG4c0w

From the start, President Trump has denied the facts about how to best fight the coronavirus. Now, he wants Americans to put loyalty to him ahead of the health of their children, parents, and siblings. #DeadlineWH https://t.co/Ifc0blPrNf

Right now, 40 million Americans are at risk of eviction. Through no fault of their own, they can't make rent payments. And yet, more than 100 days after the House passed the #HeroesAct, Republicans still refuse to deliver critically needed rental assistance. #FamiliesFirst
Republicans have made it clear: they do not understand the gravity of the situation facing America's working families. The #HeroesAct includes the solutions we need to get a handle on this crisis. #inners https://t.co/OUMtGO8vgX

Today's unprecedented ruling by a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel is a challenge to our system of checks &amp; balances, and is at odds with Supreme Court precedent. The House will immediately pursue an en banc rehearing of this decision. https://t.co/oNqII9mYPx

Democrats remain committed to protecting the @USPS, and will vote this Saturday on @RepMaloney's Delivering for America Act, providing $25 billion in support of the Postal Service as the USPS Board of Governors recommended, 100 percent appointed by Trump.
This, taken with his unwillingness to plan for adequate worker overtime, directly jeopardizes the election and threatens to disenfranchise voters in communities of color, while also slowing delivery of medicines to veterans. https://t.co/uN0ETY2kSK
Earlier today, I spoke with Postmaster General DeJoy regarding his alleged pause in operational changes. During our conversation, he admitted he has no intention of replacing the sorting machines, blue mailboxes and other infrastructure that have been removed.

Today, we mark #BlackWomensEqualPayDay — the day in 2020 when Black women's pay finally catches up with white men's for 2019. We all must do our part every single day to shrink this gap. The House passed the #PaycheckFairness Act over a year ago. What's your excuse, @senategop?

Democrats have compromised. Repeatedly, we have made clear to the Trump Admin that we are willing to come down $1 trillion if they will come up $1 trillion. However, it is clear that the Admin still does not grasp the magnitude of the problems that American families are facing.
Right now, children in America are going hungry – and yet Republicans refuse to deliver the unemployment insurance &amp; nutrition assistance their families need. Grateful to all who are fasting today &amp; otherwise calling for Republicans to work with Democrats to #SaveThe600!
Republicans refused to take action to feed hungry children nationwide during this pandemic – but they did make sure to give business a massive tax break for corporate lunches. #TheReidOut https://t.co/sHLmkP16u8

Make no mistake: Voter suppression is a crisis in this country and #COVID19 only makes it harder for Americans to get to the polls. \n\nOur country needs a national plan to vote by mail.
Let's be clear: The #ClimateCrisis has disproportionately affected people of color and low-income communities.\n\nThat's why House Democrats are focused on solutions that will protect our planet and create good-paying jobs by investing in communities that have been left behind.
Protecting and expanding health care. Creating good-paying jobs. Rebuilding neglected infrastructure. Tackling police brutality. Defending justice and equality. \n\nHouse Democrats have been fighting #ForThePeople since DAY ONE. Where is @senatemajldr?
Our roads and bridges are crumbling. Our schools are falling apart. Our infrastructure is in CRISIS.\n\nHouse Democrats passed the #MovingForwardAct to improve the safety and mobility of our nation's infrastructure #ForThePeople.
Every single one of us has a responsibility to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.\n\nThat starts with wearing a mask.
House Democrats have been clear since day one: Protecting and expanding health care is our top priority. Full stop.
House Democrats have successfully passed #COVID19 relief measures for American families, workers, health care professionals and small businesses. \n\nBut the country needs more. That's why we passed the #HeroesAct.\n\nAmerica is waiting, @senatemajldr.
Countless brave Americans have fought and died for their right to vote. Change is LONG overdue.\n\nHouse Democrats are fighting to ensure EVERY American has full and equal access to this fundamental right.
The Trump administration has continued its relentless attacks on health care during a deadly pandemic. There is no rock bottom. \n\nHouse Democrats will ALWAYS fight to expand and protect access to quality, affordable health care.
This is what voter suppression looks like. In the year 2020, people shouldn't have to wait in line for 5 hours to exercise a constitutional right to vote. We need federal law which respects democracy and makes it easy to vote in every state and end all forms of voter suppression. https://t.co/07ReQPK5kH
On #PrimeDay, let's not forget. During the pandemic, Jeff Bezos became $97 billion richer by increasing prices by up to 1,000% on essential items and denying hazard pay and paid sick leave to over 450,000 of his workers. It's time to break up Amazon and tax the rich.

I know some of you are thinking of sitting this election out. Let me tell you why that is not an option. https://t.co/dNQpyHlSRf
During this pandemic 215,000 Americans have died and 12 million lost health care. Meanwhile, billionaires in the health care industry became $150 billion richer. The function of a rational health care system is to guarantee quality care for all, not make the rich even richer.
The Native American people must be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve. We all must stand with them in the fight improve their quality of life and to protect their treaties and tribal rights. #IndigenousPeoplesDay

Ten weeks ago, 30 million unemployed workers stopped receiving $600/week in benefits because the Senate GOP thought $600 was too generous. Since then, the 4 richest Americans gained $54 billion and now own $524 billion in wealth. We need an economy that works for all, not the 1%.
Let's be clear. It would be much less expensive to enact the Green New Deal than it would be to continue to allow the fossil fuel industry to destroy the planet we live on. And it would create millions of good-paying jobs in the process.
The American people will not be intimidated by bullies who practice voter suppression and intimidation. We will vote in record-breaking numbers. We will defeat Trump. We will save American democracy.\nhttps://t.co/v1ce9hjsdT

Wealth of U.S. billionaires in 2009: $1.3 trillion\n\nWealth of U.S. billionaires in 2020: $3.6 trillion\n\nMinimum wage in 2009: $7.25/hr\n\nMinimum wage in 2020: $7.25/hr\n\nYes. We need to increase the minimum wage to $15/hr, tax the wealth of billionaires and expand Medicare to All.
In the last few days Trump has been for a stimulus package, against it, and for it. What will the \"stable genius\" say next? All I know is every unemployed worker needs $600 a week. Working class families need $2,000 a month. And every American needs the same health care as Trump.
While Trump received over $100,000 in free government health care for himself, he's attempting to throw 20 million Americans off their health care. Yes. Trump, the self-proclaimed billionaire, believes in government help for himself, but rugged individualism for everyone else.
This is what an irrational economy looks like. Billionaires get richer &amp; pay less in taxes while millions are unemployed, kids go hungry, veterans sleep on the street. We must stand up to the billionaire class and create an economy for all, not just a few. https://t.co/GR5VEZoOcp
The Trump administration's policy of separating families is a moral stain on this nation. It is inhumane. And all those responsible must be held accountable for the harm they have done. We need an immigration system based on justice, not cruelty. https://t.co/VgzexVcSl6

After receiving the best socialized health care in the world Trump just said \"no\" to providing any relief to the unemployed, the uninsured or the hungry. But he's still pushing the Senate to confirm a Supreme Court nominee who will strip health care from 20 million. How pathetic.
Mr. President: You attack "socialized medicine" every single day. Well, let's be clear. The excellent care you received at Walter Reed was at a 100% government-funded, government run hospital. For Trump, \"socialized medicine\" is bad for everyone but himself. Total hypocrisy!
West Virginians deserve a voice in Congress who will look out for the working class and address their economic pain. When @Kunkel4Congress gets to Washington, that is exactly what she will do. https://t.co/deJMYO7cti
I believe every person in America is entitled to the same health care as the President of the United States—with no co-pays, no deductibles and no out-of-pocket expenses. If government-funded health care is good enough for Trump, it is good enough for all of us as a human right.
In addition, voting sites are opening today near three colleges: East Lansing near MSU, on campus at Western Michigan University and Northern Michigan University. Detroit is also opening 21 early voting sites across the city which will be open 7 days a week until Election Day.

We can provide everyone in America high-quality health care for a year—the kind of care Trump is getting right now—by taxing 60% of the wealth gains billionaires made in the last 6 months. I've introduced a bill with @EdMarkey and @SenGillibrand to do just that. Let's do it.
With Joe Biden as president and a Democratic Congress, we will:\n\n-⬆️ the minimum wage to $15/hr\n- Make public colleges tuition-free for working families\n- Substantially reduce student debt\n- Lower the age for Medicare to 60\n- Improve Medicare to include dental, vision &amp; hearing
At this critical and unprecedented moment in American history, it is absolutely imperative that we stand together and elect Joe Biden as the next president of the United States. https://t.co/So2KSL3PbW

We need an economic relief deal NOW. Too many Americans are unemployed – with millions facing hunger, lack of health care and eviction. The working families of this country need a strong agreement to protect them and their kids. Let's do it.
The Senate must act now to prevent tens of thousands of flight attendants and airline workers from losing their jobs and their paychecks. These workers cannot afford to wait any longer. They need our help now. https://t.co/bX2RyD0OTC

Jane and I wish the President and First Lady a full and speedy recovery. The COVID-19 virus is real, it is dangerous and can infect anybody. As a nation we must do all we can to fight this virus and protect the American people.

This election isn't just Trump vs. Biden. It's: \n\nTrump vs. Democracy\nTrump vs. Science\nTrump vs. A $15/hr minimum wage\nTrump vs. Universal childcare\nTrump vs. Expanding health care\nTrump vs. Making college available to all\n\nDespair is not an option. Too much is at stake.
Last night Trump was asked to condemn white supremacy—and refused. He has called neo-Nazis \"very fine people.\" He has inspired disgusting acts of racism and violence. This is the most dangerous president in the modern history of our country. He must be defeated.
The business model on Wall Street is fraud. It's not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. There will not be justice on Wall Street until we make it clear that no bank is too big too fail and no Wall Street CEO is too big to jail. https://t.co/CdyzxKg0ko
While Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2017, the 139 trips he has taken to his country clubs as president cost American taxpayers $141 million. Yes. This is a president who believes in corporate socialism if you're a billionaire and rugged capitalism for the rest.
While Donald Trump paid just $750 in U.S. federal income taxes during the first year of his presidency, he paid over $317,000 in taxes to India, Panama and the Philippines. How's that for America first?
Trump is either:\n\nA) A bad businessman who has lost money year after year after year. \nB) A tax cheat who has avoided paying what he owes in taxes year after year after year. \n\nKnowing Donald Trump, both are probably true. https://t.co/CMpgpJeZ7b

Trump and his allies are doing everything possible to suppress the vote and undermine American democracy.  That is what authoritarians do. They must not be allowed to succeed. Let us stand together, have the largest voter turnout in American history and send Trump packing.
What a hypocrite! While Trump makes hateful &amp; racist rants about how immigrants are "bad" for the country, the undocumented immigrants he hired to work at his country clubs paid more in federal income taxes than Trump. What's bad for the country? Billionaires who don't pay taxes.
Leona Helmsley, multi-billionaire hotel heiress: \"Only the little people pay taxes\" \n\nYep:\n\nTrump paid no income taxes in 10/15 years\nAmazon paid no income taxes in 3 years\nBillionaires pay lower tax rate than the middle class\nTop 1% avoided $800 billion in taxes \n\n#TaxTheRich
Trump's tax returns tell us that he's either a very bad businessman or a tax cheat—likely both.\n\nBut more importantly, it shows how the wealthy, unlike most Americans, are able to avoid paying taxes.\n\nThe top 1% is responsible for 70% of unpaid taxes.\n\nIt's time to tax the rich.
The election is 36 days away. The American people should have their say in that election before Mitch McConnell pushes through a lifelong appointment to the Supreme Court.
Shock of shocks! Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed billionaire, received a $72.9 million tax refund from the IRS while not paying a nickel in federal income taxes in 10 out of 15 years. \n\nYep. Trump l-o-v-e-s corporate socialism for himself, rugged capitalism for everyone else.
What the Senate should approve:\n\n-$600/week for 30 million unemployed workers\n-$2,000 a month for working class Americans\n-An emergency expansion of Medicare to all\n\nWhat the Senate should not approve:\n\nA Supreme Court nominee before Inauguration Day.

Never in this country's history have we failed to have a peaceful transition of power from one president to the next. We must do all we can to make sure Trump isn't the first. In this election the future of American democracy is at stake. We must not lose.\nhttps://t.co/Z8z2I7cYfQ
Breonna Taylor's life mattered. This result is a disgrace and an abdication of justice. Our criminal justice system is racist. The time for fundamental change is now. https://t.co/IPmO9upXbK
Trump promised to protect rural Americans. He lied, and bailed out the billionaire class instead.\n\nJoin our town hall this weekend with @PplsAction on fighting for rural America and how we must defeat Trump in November.\n\nTune in Saturday at 1 p.m. ET at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/qm3eFTX4mA
I am 79, and I am angry.\n\nIf I were 18 or 20, I would be very, very, very angry.\n\nYoung people can transform this country. We must do everything we can to ensure they vote in this election. https://t.co/RIeUyphJ2o
"When [Latinos] went out and voted in 2018, we changed a Congress that looked more like America — the most Latinas, the most women, the most LGBTQ+, the most people that believed in science when it comes to climate change." –@MariaTeresa1 https://t.co/PztFPdQAAn
\"It's Trump first, not America first. He has hooked up his billionaire friends and donors, and he has excused and encouraged cruelty to our communities… He may think he's running the country like a reality show, but it's our lives." –@marisa_franco https://t.co/epvy3ap5rJ
\"We cannot allow [Trump] to continue facilitating deaths in attacking the immigrant community, in abusing Puerto Ricans… We need to transform those frustrations into the power and the fuel that will take us out to the polls." –@thaiscarrero https://t.co/KVR9hJH9tt
There is a reason why our death rate per capita in terms of COVID-19 is much higher than almost any other country. We have a president who from the beginning downplayed this pandemic and who is at war with science, doctors and researchers. https://t.co/bJ6if5WSkS
\"We have a very strong story to tell, as Democrats, to the Latino community.\" –@JulianCastro https://t.co/0PbJdMz10K
We have to develop strong policies that speak to the needs of the Latino community and reach out specifically to Latino voters to bring them into the political process. https://t.co/kAkihMHiSZ
The stakes of this November's election could not be higher, and now is a time for us all to get involved and create the nation we can become. Join me now for a live town hall with @JulianCastro and more, presented by @UniNoticias. https://t.co/oYGYQFwRiM
Our town hall is starting soon. Tune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS at 7 p.m. ET. https://t.co/fS8ATferMM

This year Latinos are expected to be, for the first time, the largest racial or ethnic minority in a U.S. presidential election. TONIGHT at 7 ET, watch our town hall on the importance of the Latino vote this November at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/PjnhO1XSQf
The Trump administration awarded:\n\n➡️$183 million to companies like Rolls-Royce to build more warships\n➡️$155 million to Boeing &amp; General Electric for more fighter jets\n➡10s of millions for more drones\n\nAll this money was meant to be used for more masks and tests.\n\nDisgusting. https://t.co/6NpdX8XzEF
This election is about democracy vs. authoritarianism.\n\nOn Thursday I will be giving an address on the unprecedented and dangerous moment we are in right now given President Donald Trump's unique threats to our democracy.\n\nTune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS Thursday at 1 p.m. ET. https://t.co/p9q4KP77oa

I'm proud to endorse @Bradshaw2020's grassroots campaign. Marquita is building a strong grassroots movement by standing up to big-money politics and challenging the status quo. I believe her bold, progressive movement, powered by the people, can make history in Tennessee. https://t.co/U5asEvEPYk

She is a fighter for Medicare for All and understands that the Green New Deal will not only combat climate change but will create good-paying jobs. I'm proud to endorse her. https://t.co/a8RyIBp4aY
Here's a radical idea. Instead of arresting poor Americans — disproportionately African American and Latino — for possessing marijuana, let's start prosecuting the crooks on Wall Street for laundering money for drug cartels, suspected terrorists and corrupt foreign officials.

This election is not just about Democrat vs. Republican. It is about democracy vs. authoritarianism.
After the 2016 election, Trump said that "millions of people voted illegally."\n\nThat's when he won.\n\nWhat will he say in 2020 if he loses?\n\nWe need to understand and be prepared for the fact that Trump will do whatever it takes to maintain the power of the presidency.
This is what authoritarianism looks like. An American president does not praise violence against a reporter for doing his job. That is what an ugly, insecure two-bit dictator does. The future of our democracy and a free press is at stake this election. We must defeat Trump badly. https://t.co/VkfxN5NL7T
This is what Senator Lindsey Graham, the current Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said back in 2018. Let's see if he has an ounce of integrity left and will keep his word. https://t.co/VKk6M6jScA
The passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a tremendous loss to our country. She was an extraordinary champion of justice and equal rights, and will be remembered as one of the great justices in modern American history.
This election is between a corrupt president who got $200,000 a year from his dad's empire starting at the age of three and a candidate who grew up in a working class family. https://t.co/BpAZMry4Te
Mail in voter fraud rate: 0.0025%.\n\nNumber of lies Trump has made since he has been president: Over 20,000 and counting.\n\nWe don't have a problem with mail-in voting fraud. We have a problem with a president who is a pathological liar and is actively trying to suppress the vote.
The Trump administration's handling of the pandemic has been an utter, deadly disaster.\n\nSending each American 5 high-quality masks would have saved tens of thousands of lives.\n\nThe good news: if implemented now, it still could. My Masks for All legislation would do just that. https://t.co/SOc49qbSRo
Trump has to stop this nonsense about mail-in ballots being fraudulent.\n\nEvery vote cast in this country must be counted. https://t.co/oenqAGg7mN
In-person early voting starts today in:\n\n➡️Virginia\n➡️Minnesota\n➡️South Dakota\n➡️Wyoming\n\nLet's stand together. Let's defeat Trump. Let's defend democracy. Find your voting information now: https://t.co/Q11p3BUgIQ
At a time when the 1% and corporations are gaining more and more wealth, we have got to invest in working people who are severely hurting during this crisis. Congratulations to New Jersey on this important step forward. https://t.co/6LFtbgPzDy
Joe Biden is absolutely right: No worker should make less than $15/hr. When we defeat Trump and elect progressives to Congress, not only will we raise the minimum wage to $15/hr—we'll create millions of jobs and raise wages for all by expanding unions. https://t.co/Lqcf7bjHc8

Thousands of taxi workers are struggling to put food on the table because of the greed of predatory lenders and massive rideshare companies. I stand with @NYTWA taking action today—the debt of these workers must be forgiven now. https://t.co/hZJNCBFXsv
During the past 6 months of the pandemic, while 30 million Americans lost jobs, 12 million lost health insurance and 40 million face eviction, the richest 15 Americans gained an obscene $400 billion in wealth. It is time to tell the billionaire class that they cannot have it all.
Let me congratulate the nurses in Asheville, North Carolina, for the largest union victory in the South since 1975. What the nurses in Asheville demonstrated is that when you stand together, when you fight back against corporate greed, justice and dignity will prevail. https://t.co/H0DC5mL0X2
The Green New Deal is not too expensive. What is far more expensive is allowing our planet to burn up, lives lost, and homes destroyed because of the endless greed of a handful of fossil fuel executives.
When Trump talks about \"herd immunity\" he shows his ineptness, is surrendering to the pandemic and is sentencing hundreds of thousands more Americans to death. Whether it's climate change or the pandemic we need a president who believes in science — and that's not Trump. https://t.co/9KRxFmBKFa
All that we're talking about in this election is the future of our democracy, the future of our economy, the future of our health care system—and oh, by the way, the future of the planet.\n\nOther than that, not much is at stake.
.@karaforcongress is facing the same incumbent Republican she came within just 1.9% of defeating two years ago while running on a strong progressive platform that prioritizes the needs of working people in Omaha and beyond. Let's make sure Kara is elected to Congress this year. https://t.co/kEINTeFRRC

.@Kunkel4Congress knows West Virginians are ready for a political and economic system that works for all, not just the wealthy.

@SeeMiaRoll Thank you (and Zini) so much!
When politicians use faith as an excuse to pass and uphold laws that seize control of people's bodies but not guarantee them healthcare, feed the poor, shelter the homeless, or welcome the stranger, you have to wonder if it's really about faith at all.
Sick and tired of Republicans who co-opt faith as an excuse to advance bigotry and barbarism.\n\nFact is, if today Christ himself came to the floor of Congress and repeated his teachings, many would malign him as a radical and eject him from the chamber. https://t.co/y19PBDw5co
Maybe we should be. https://t.co/AC5491EW56
Genuine question for the media / law enforcement: why are you calling these armed neo-nazi groups breaking the law "militias" instead of "gangs" or "domestic terrorist groups?"
Journalists:"How do you feel about the Green New Deal" is not a climate change question.\n\nTry: "What is your plan to bring down emissions?" so voters actually understand if a candidate even *has* a plan for the worst impending crisis of our time, and can share what it is.
I still can't get over how bad the climate change section of the debate was last night.\n\nThis is the consequence of no climate questions in debates for years.\n\nThe questions were childish, no follow-up questions for basic information, &amp; there was almost no talk of solutions.
Just to be clear: there is nothing "pro-life" about denying people comprehensive sexual education, making birth control harder to access, forcing others to give birth against their will, and stripping them of healthcare and food assistance afterwards.
So what IS the Green New Deal, anyway? https://t.co/hqjMSpgxDg
For the record @Mike_Pence, it's Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez to you.
Pence demanding that Harris answer *his* own personal questions when he won't even answer the moderator's is gross, and exemplary of the gender dynamics so many women have to deal with at work.
Why is it that Mike Pence doesn't seem to have to answer any of the questions asked of him in this debate?
The Green New Deal is and has been lied about nonstop, and yet is STILL popular.\n\nIt's a massive job-creation and infrastructure plan to decarbonize &amp; increase quality of work and life.\n\nIt's okay to call the GOP out on those lies just as we call them out on all their other lies.
Fracking is bad, actually

What an anti-everybody agenda looks like:\n\nThe President &amp; GOP are walking away from getting ANY COVID stimulus relief done, effectively endangering millions, after *they* themselves got COVID &amp; enjoyed free socialized healthcare, so they can push through an anti-ACA SCOTUS pick. https://t.co/zIidL1d6Rr

@MaxRose4NY Ugggh you beat me to this idea! 🤣
There's no questionnaire about symptoms, no requirement to report to the House physician if we are experiencing symptoms, no temperature check upon arrival to DC, nothing.\n\nThen we all get on planes and travel back to our communities, often twice a week. It's dangerous.
400-500+ members of Congress regularly travel from every corner of the country to DC &amp; back.\n\nEach time we convene carries with it the potential of a superspreader event.\n\nIt's absolutely unacceptable that there is no regular temp-taking, testing, or contact tracing protocol. https://t.co/kMdujmNGmJ

Donald Trump is a white supremacist.\n\nPeople have been warning about this for a long time.\n\nThey were ridiculed, called hyperbolic &amp; radical - not bc they were wrong, but bc others couldn't accept that our country elected a supremacist as President.\n\nThis is fascism at our door. https://t.co/sahloCJt25
This isn't news, Kellyanne.\n\nOur differences are exactly why I joined Biden's Climate Unity Task Force - so we could set aside our differences &amp; figure out an aggressive climate plan to address the planetary crisis at our feet.\n\nTrump doesn't even believe climate change is real. https://t.co/Bj8SMD9Syf

Last year Republicans blasted a firehose of hatred + vitriol my way because I treated myself to a $250 cut &amp; lowlights on my birthday.\n\nWhere's the criticism of their idol spending $70k on hairstyling?\n\nOh, it's nowhere because they're spineless, misogynistic hypocrites? Got it. https://t.co/xCQGwW7EK5
In 2016 &amp; ‘17, I paid thousands of dollars a year in taxes *as a bartender.*\n\nTrump paid $750.\n\nHe contributed less to funding our communities than waitresses &amp; undocumented immigrants.\n\nDonald Trump has never cared for our country more than he cares for himself. A walking scam. https://t.co/VZChbp8htu

Some more information on the filibuster's history for those interested: https://t.co/etSr7BZawO
Sen. Feinstein's protection of the filibuster is unjust &amp; unacceptable.\n\nThe filibuster wasn't made w/ purpose. It‘s the result of an accident in rulebook revision &amp; bloomed as a cherished tool of segregationists.\n\nNow it empowers minority rule. That's not "special," it's unjust. https://t.co/anKwCSbQWb
Congressional GOP have made one thing extremely clear:\nTo them, there are no rules.\nThere are no principles.\nThere is only power.\n\nThey are ruthless, and always have been in my lifetime.\n\nDems must recognize they cannot be reasoned with at present &amp; better adapt to that reality. https://t.co/DPq6xj61fF

And after we work to command victory in November, I need folks to realize that there's no going back to brunch.\n\nWe have a whole new world to build.

Here's what we're NOT gonna do: give up.\n\nWe don't give up when people need us most. That's not who we are.\n\nOur democracy is at a faint heartbeat; it was broken even before Trump. But so long as we can save lives, I believe we have an obligation to do so as we build a new world. https://t.co/QBGqflpihC
You do not need to, nor should you, ignore your fears - there is plenty to be afraid of - but we have possibilities before us.\n\nWe can win, we can succeed, but we cannot do it alone. We will need the people.\n\nWe must get to work.\nEveryone matters.\nEveryone has something to give.
Our first, no 1 priority is to do everything possible to secure electoral college victory in Nov. \n\nThis is the fight of and for our lives. That has always been true, &amp; it becomes more true each day.\n\nOpponents of democracy need your resignation to succeed. Don't give it to them.
Now is not the time for cynicism or hopelessness. There is and continues to be political possibility to preserve our democracy &amp; move forward.\n\nIt will require each &amp; every one of us, from the streets to the Senate, to grow in courage, strength, and strategy. But it is possible.
We have lost a giant in the history of our nation with the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nIt is heartbreaking that in her final moments she was, as are many others, preoccupied with what would happen after her passing.\n\nI want to make one thing clear: we can, and must, fight. https://t.co/QEDDFtSwmK
Believe me, I too wish that a little carbon tax here &amp;a little fuel efficiency there would solve this.\n\nThere was a time in the early 90s where those policies could've made an enormous difference. But our leadership failed &amp; ran out the clock. Now we need WWII-level mobilization.
It's almost as if the climate crisis was punted for so long due to fossil fuel lobbyists &amp; weak political leadership that it‘s exploded to become so large + lethal that we now need a massive infrastructure &amp; jobs plan to decarbonize the economy on a rapid timeline\n\n#GreenNewDeal https://t.co/Nda7IHdobw

It wasn't just the right wing.\n\nThe reason I didn't choose a more comfortable term for "targeting &amp; detaining groups largely by ethnicity w/o trial in camps w/ malnutrition, sexual assault, permanent psychological trauma + bodily harm" is bc we shouldn't be comfortable about it. https://t.co/0A7zIgvdCg
Cannabis should be legalized &amp; records should be expunged ASAP.\n\nIt's strange that the more conservative step of decriminalization is seen by some as too controversial or "risky."\n\nEach day we postpone is a day we let communities be ravaged &amp; profiled. It must end. #LegalizeIt https://t.co/axFMm1f3fT
It's astounding that after a massive family separation operation, mass sexual assault of detainees, trapping immigrants in COVID-infected detention centers, and now reports of mass hysterectomies (which the US has done before), abolishing ICE is controversial.\n\nWhere's the line?
The fact of the matter is the United States has engaged in a program of mass human rights violations targeting immigrants.\n\nThis includes mass child separation, systemic sexual assault of people in detention, kangaroo-court procedures, &amp; more.\n\nOur country must atone for it all. https://t.co/KaacDaww5t
The HEROES Act the House passed months ago covers several (but not all) of these points.\n\nGOP Senators, pledging allegiance to Mitch McConnell, have intentionally sat on this bill &amp; did nothing.\n\nPeople are starving. Babies are sleeping on car floors. Where is the needed urgency?
Mass evictions could be prevented if Congress prioritized struggling people 1/2 as much as it prioritizes Wall St bailouts.\n\nIt's never too late to help people w/:\n- rent + mortgage relief\n- 2nd stim check\n- UI extension\n- Emergency state &amp; local funding\n- Expand Medicare\n&amp; more https://t.co/1C8WbAkA89

(And btw - if they give a substantive answer to open a conversation, great! But words matter a great deal in moments like these, and we shouldn't simply repeat them without giving real thought to understanding why)
For media outlets and journalists choosing to use the word "boycott" over "strike," we should ask them to explain why.
Your cover title is wrong.\n\nYou need to change it to STRIKE. https://t.co/zur1HmkEHy
NBA players are courageously on strike (withholding labor), NOT boycotting (withholding their $ /purchase). The diff is important bc it shows their power as *workers.*\n\nThe courage this takes is profound. WNBA organizing in this moment MUST be recognized too. #StrikeForBlackLives https://t.co/QfsJAHLVLx

Say it with me: the issue of DC &amp; Puerto Rico statehood are not 👏🏽 the 👏🏽 same.👏🏽\n\nPR is a colony of the United States.\n\nJustice isn't the colonizing country deciding fate for the colonized.

@KaleighRogers Normally I would agree, but this instance went far, far beyond a tweet - the article, headline, etc repeated the frame and reposted across multiple social networks and their own website SEO
@RepBrendanBoyle Thanks @RepBrendanBoyle!
The woman the GOP picked as their "proud" Latina to tout "immigrant experience" didn't seem to know that Puerto Rico is already part of the United States.\n\nIt's quite on message, bc it reflects their belief that Latinos aren't real citizens, even when we are Native descendants. https://t.co/I7iU3yEGT0
Here is my new mascot proposal:\n\nProgressives take elephants from Republicans, bc they are compassionate, empathetic creatures w nuanced social structures. \n\nGeneral Dems can keep Donkeys if desired - we can unite under that tent.\n\nRepublicans are Honey Badgers

The House passed a second stimulus &amp; UI extensions months ago.\n\nRepublicans have abandoned the process bc they got their big corporate bailout wish in CARES. Wall St was/is their main priority, so now they have no incentive to come back to the table to help people. It's shameful.

Ed Markey earns people's support bc he is a Senator who actually uses his power and privilege to advance change, instead of denigrating, watering down, or finger-wagging the community leaders demanding it.\n\nI cannot communicate enough how rare a quality that is in Washington. https://t.co/IIF8vNCuum

@TaylorLorenz It's easy to say "don't read the comments," but that's nearly impossible when part of your job is engaging the public w/ your work.\n\nIf you're going to do it, try to look for substantive responses &amp; don't get stuck in bad faith stuff.\n\nYour reporting is impt &amp;has taught me a lot!
Ilhan's multimillion challenge was bankrolled by DC lobbyists &amp; dark money groups.\n\nHe blatantly admitted to using shell corporations to get around the DCCC blacklist, which all but means his vendors work w/ the Democratic Party.\n\nYet DCCC hasn't enforced policy. I wonder why 🤔
No one gets to complain about primary challenges again. 🤗\n\nSo @dccc, when can we expect you to reverse your blacklist policy against primary orgs?\n\nBecause between this &amp; lack of care around @IlhanMN's challenger, it seems like less a policy and more a cherry-picking activity. https://t.co/xSneSK8H2q

.@NBCNews still hasn't apologized.\n\nIt doesn't matter how big a "legacy brand" a news division has, this kind of manipulative behavior is dangerous &amp; needs to be checked.\n\nWe saw what happened in ‘16. This recklessness will easily extend to the Dem ticket if it doesn't stop now. https://t.co/zBe7rGGQAh
I am taking this seriously because we have seen this recklessness before in ‘16.\n\nWe have seen click-hungry media coverage bring voters to a froth for no reason but views.\n\nIt was me this week, but they will do it to Kamala, Biden, or anyone else next week. It needs to stop now.
Yes. NBC's misleading headline, which had thousands of people confused and angry, wasn't a mistake. It was clickbait.\n\nIt wasn't just a tweet, either. It was repeated in other headlines &amp; posts.\n\n@NBCNews still hasn't apologized. As stated here, this is on their entire news team. https://t.co/oV12mFitci

These horrifying ICE reports are not one-off incidents.\n\nICE, like many unjust structures, is not "broken."

So @NBCNews how are you going to fix the incredible amount of damage and misinformation that you are now responsible for?\n\nBecause a 1:15am tweet to slip under the radar after blowing up a totally false and divisive narrative across networks isn't it. https://t.co/zf6Wqiotvv
This is completely unacceptable, disappointing, and appalling.\n\nThe DNC shared the procedural purpose of my remarks to media WELL in advance. @NBC knew what was going to happen &amp; that it was routine.\n\nHow does a headline that malicious &amp; misleading happen w/ that prior knowledge?
You waited several hours to correct your obvious and blatantly misleading tweet.\n\nIt sparked an enormous amount of hatred and vitriol, &amp; now the misinfo you created is circulating on other networks.\n\nAll to generate hate-clicks from a pre-recorded, routine procedural motion. https://t.co/crDlEymgMD

We can build bridges &amp; not lose sight of our values.\n\nIt's important to remember that Kasich is an anti-choice extremist. He 100% will (and has) signed away our reproductive rights the moment he has the opportunity to do so. He is not a friend to workers.\nhttps://t.co/7S8504VZcK
It's great that Kasich has woken up &amp;realized the importance of supporting a Biden-Harris ticket.

It's not a coincidence that the GOP advanced tropes about non-citizenship to President Obama, Reps. Tlaib, Omar &amp; Pressley, &amp; now Sen. Kamala Harris; especially in moments of power.\n\nImplying poc "don't belong" in our country is one way of protecting a white supremacist vision.
Whether it's "where's the birth certificate?" to "send her back!" to "where were her parents from?"- these contrived claims (which are almost never levied at white US officials born abroad) catch on bc the supremacist idea that poc are inherently less legitimate has deep roots.
White supremacy is a belief system based on the idea that ppl of color, esp Black ppl, are fundamentally illegitimate as equal citizens or human beings.\n\nCalling into question the citizenship of elected officials of color, esp when the answer is obvious, is one way it manifests.
It's not just Trump that‘s destroying the US Post Office.\n\nIt's the entire Republican Party.\n\nSenate &amp; House GOP could easily override a Trump veto of postal funding and help oversight.\n\nRepublicans are working with Trump to destroy the USPS and sabotage the delivery of ballots. https://t.co/5qIMUDxQot

Billionaires need the working class. \n\nThe working class does not need billionaires.
Another reason we need real economic support for families (extended UI, stimulus checks, payment relief, etc) is to make school reopening plans w/ the purpose of maximizing public health, rather than sacrifice peoples' lives to fuel an economy that doesn't even value theirs.

Just as purveyors of misinformation are constantly testing new techniques, so should we in verifying info.\n\nNot everything we try is going to work. Is a ban on political ads the best route? Prob not. But at least there's a willingness to recognize how dangerous misinfo is &amp; act.
I appreciate that Twitter is a platform that‘s at least *trying* to stop disinformation, verifying news outlets, etc.\n\nStopping misinformation isn't abt sitting around for years debating ideas.\n\nIt's about testing tactics, trying ideas, etc to find what's effective. https://t.co/O213ih0Rof

Absolutely incredible.\n\nCongratulations, @CoriBush - YOU accomplished this w/ the people of Ferguson &amp; #MO1.\n\nYou‘ve shown that the power of grassroots, mass-movement politics is stronger than gatekeepers &amp; big money - it's about advancing the tide of justice whose time has come. https://t.co/mYOZKxitEW
Pretty nauseating how easily Congress rubber stamped a $4 trillion dark slush fund for Wall St as "COVID relief," yet somehow $600 for workers in pandemic is controversial.\n\nUp close it's staggering how much resistance there is in Washington to actually helping people directly.
I wrote a bill before Trump was sworn in to enforce the clause banning the President from taking foreign payments. I expanded it in my bill to #EndCorruptionNow. If the Court won't uphold the ban on these conflicts, Congress should do it and pass my bill. https://t.co/e9NAtITUC6
Yet another example of why Trump &amp; Republican senators are working hard to steal this Supreme Court seat: they want to hand the Court to extremists &amp; undermine our democracy.
