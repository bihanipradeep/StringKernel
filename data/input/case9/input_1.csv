My sincerest condolences go to his devoted wife, Pat, and the rest of the Hume family at this difficult time.
His vision paved the way for the stability, positivity and dynamism of the Northern Ireland of today and his passing is a powerful reminder of how far Northern Ireland has come.
With his passing we have lost a great man who did so much to help bring an end to the Troubles and build a better future for all.
He led the SDLP with great distinction for more than twenty years, driven by a strong sense of social justice, and continued to be a revered figure for many throughout these islands and further afield.
For decades he sought resolution of the Troubles in Northern Ireland through dialogue and agreement. Without John Hume there would have been no Belfast or Good Friday Agreement.
John Hume was quite simply a political giant. He stood proudly in the tradition that was totally opposed to violence and committed to pursuing his objectives by exclusively peaceful and democratic means.

It was a pleasure to welcome @SecPompeo to Downing Street today. We reaffirmed our countries' strong relationship and commitment to working together on the fight against coronavirus, shared security concerns and a UK-US free trade agreement. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 https://t.co/HJD8Z8m0IT
We've kept our promises. We have recruited thousands of nurses & police officers, and invested billions more in our NHS & schools.  Of course there is much more to do. As we begin to recover from this pandemic, we will not lose sight of the country we have promised to build 🇬🇧 https://t.co/ycz2pv0T3q

As our lives slowly return to normal, there are some precautions we must take. From next Friday in England, we must all wear a face covering in shops and supermarkets, as well as on public transport. This will protect others and help stop the spread.
We're making sure the NHS has the resources it needs to prepare for winter. But even as we plan for the worst, I strongly believe we should also hope for the best. https://t.co/pRJahCvEpP
This weekend, many of us will be seeing friends, going to the pub or going out to restaurants. As we open the economy back up, we must remember to follow social distancing guidelines. Keep yourself, your family and your community safe.
9: But it has to be right that we take local action in response to local outbreaks - there is no point shutting down a city in one part of the country to contain an outbreak in another part of the country.
8: I know that it will be hard going for people affected by these local measures. It isn't easy, and for some it may seem unjust that people just a short distance away can live their lives closer to normal.
7: Where justified by evidence, ministers will be able to close whole sectors or types of premises in an area, introduce local stay at home orders, prevent people entering or leaving defined areas, reduce maximum gathering size, or restrict transport systems serving local areas.
6: Action by local councils will not always be sufficient, so next week we will publish draft regulations explaining how central government can intervene at a local level.
5: From today, local authorities will have new powers in their areas, to close specific premises, shut public outdoor spaces, and cancel events. This will enable them to act more quickly in response to outbreaks, where speed is paramount.
4: In Leicester, we instituted a local lockdown in order to bear down on stubborn rates of infection. We will begin to relax the restrictions there next week. We can do so because the data is improving.
3: In Bradford and Blackburn with Darwen, we identified troubling trends in the data and worked closely with the respective local authorities to increase testing and take targeted action. That work continues.
2: This work is led by NHS Test and Trace in England. Our approach is already working. In Weston-super-Mare and Kirklees, we took swift and successful action to contain outbreaks at specific premises.
1: Our understanding of the epidemiology of coronavirus and intelligence on where it is spreading has vastly improved. This means we can control it through targeted, local action.
Today I announced the next chapter in our coronavirus recovery strategy.Read my full statement here: https://t.co/uuziwLkUih https://t.co/CslhJ1uSeU

As pubs and restaurants open across England today, it's absolutely vital that everyone follows the rules on social distancing.We've worked so hard and together saved so many lives. Stick to the rules this weekend, keep apart from others and wash your hands several times a day.
Places of worship have been working hard to make their buildings COVID-19 Secure, but please check yours is ready before you leave home and work with them to make sure you and your loved ones stay safe.
Places of worship are at the heart of so many communities, which is why I am delighted that thousands of churches, mosques, synagogues, gurdwaras and temples are preparing to welcome back their congregations safely for communal prayer and religious practice.
Our goal remains to enable as many people as possible to live their lives as close to normally as possible in a way which is as fair and as safe as possible. https://t.co/q6SMGxtNst

Whilst we have been able to carefully ease some restrictions, we must #StayAlert to the very real risks of coronavirus. I would urge everyone to please remain vigilant this weekend and stick to the social distancing guidelines. If we let our guard down, cases will rise.
While nothing can properly mirror the joy of Pride celebrations in our towns and cities, #GlobalPride is a unique opportunity for people to connect with one another, in unity, across all nations. I send my best wishes to all in the LGBT community celebrating today.

Fantastic news that we are recruiting so many more doctors and nurses to our NHS. There are now 6,000 more doctors than a year ago, and 12,000 more nurses.
The government has asked a huge amount of all of you, and you have met that challenge with good humour and common sense. Of course, the fight is far from over. We must all continue to stay alert to the risk of infection, and maintain social distancing. https://t.co/Jb6ZVZPzfz

Racist thuggery has no place on our streets. Anyone attacking the police will be met with full force of the law. These marches & protests have been subverted by violence and breach current guidelines. Racism has no part in the UK and we must work together to make that a reality.
The only responsible course of action is to stay away from these protests. 8/8
But it is clear that the protests have been sadly hijacked by extremists intent on violence. The attacks on the police and indiscriminate acts of violence which we have witnessed over the last week are intolerable and they are abhorrent. 7/8
Whatever progress this country has made in fighting racism - and it has been huge - we all recognise that there is much more work to do. 6/8
As for the planned demonstrations, we all understand the legitimate feelings of outrage at what happened in Minnesota and the legitimate desire to protest against discrimination. 5/8
They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come. 4/8
We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations. 3/8
It is absurd and shameful that this national monument should today be at risk of attack by violent protestors. Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial. 2/8
The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square is a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country – and the whole of Europe – from a fascist and racist tyranny. 1/8
From this weekend, single adult households, including single parents with children under 18, can form a support bubble with one other household. We are making this intervention so that those who have been living alone for a long time can reconnect with loved ones. https://t.co/1OlJXGmUJb
Earlier this week I spoke to members of staff at Foxholes Care Home in Hertfordshire, to thank them all for their work throughout the coronavirus pandemic and beyond. #CarersWeek https://t.co/vKCr9pYwMO
We must all continue to remember those on the frontline battling this disease, and members of society who are vulnerable - and continue to do all we can to stop the spread of coronavirus.  By doing the right thing and following the rules, you are helping to save lives.
I want to say thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to all carers in the UK helping us through this pandemic.  Whether you work as a carer, or are caring for someone at home, your compassion and strength at this time is a beacon of hope for us all.   #CarersWeek
Let us work peacefully and lawfully to defeat racism and discrimination wherever we find it, and let us continue to work together as we put Britain back on its feet. https://t.co/onUqXbcCGB
People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account.
Together we have made it through the peak, but we're not yet back to normal.Please continue to #StayAlert, keep 2 metres away from others and wash your hands regularly.

Though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before.More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing.But for now we must #StayAlert, control the virus and save lives. https://t.co/SA1bDueRlp
When I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country, and that have helped to get us through this first phase, I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next. #StayAlert
If we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.We are driven by the science, the data and public health.It depends on all of us – the entire country – to #StayAlert to keep the R down. https://t.co/KuiPs7mQL8
Step 3:At the earliest by July - subject to these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, if they are safe and enforce social distancing #StayAlert
Step 2:At the earliest, by June 1 – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6. #StayAlert
And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household. #StayAlert
So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can't work from home.To ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure. #StayAlert
Step 1:We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must.We now need to stress that anyone who can't work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. #StayAlert
And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week.Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.#StayAlert
When I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below one.And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given, we have by no means fulfilled all of them.#StayAlert https://t.co/EuUhojhjBF
With every day we are getting more and more data. We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes.Our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups in your area as well as giving us a national picture. #StayAlert https://t.co/ZqDznzRjLT
Over the period of the lockdown we have been in Level Four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three.And as we go, everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down.We must all #StayAlert and follow the rules.
There will be five alert levels.Level One means the disease is no longer present in the UK.Level Five is the most critical – the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed. #StayAlert https://t.co/0Tiqjz4pzI
The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be. #StayAlert https://t.co/EuBnRDQ8KI
In turn that COVID Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level, the fewer the measures. #StayAlert https://t.co/rJgErKpThj
⬇️ THREAD ⬇️To chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new COVID Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.That COVID Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. #StayAlert https://t.co/HZAY10MF5j

To those going against the advice we're getting from our experts, you're not only putting your own life and the lives of your family at risk, you're endangering the community and you're making it more difficult for us to protect the NHS and save lives. #StayHomeSaveLives https://t.co/WLw17OboHR
The more we follow the advice, the faster the country will stage both a medical and an economic recovery in full. #StayHomeSaveLives https://t.co/ik06dvasiH
We are supporting businesses and workers in a way that government has never done before. If people stay home, then we will not only save thousands of lives, but we will come out of this pandemic all the faster. #StayHomeSaveLives https://t.co/dhraP6OSfR

I say to business, stand by your employees, stand by your workers, because we will stand by you.I have absolutely no doubt that we will turn the tide of this disease and beat it together.5/5
And it's by this combination of ruthless, determined, collective action, and scientific progress, that we're already seeing that we will succeed.If we do this together, we will save many many thousands of lives.4/5
It is absolutely vital that we follow the advice:Stay at home if you have the symptoms, or if your family has the symptoms.Avoid unnecessary contact.Avoid pubs, bars and restaurants.Work from home, if you possibly can.And wash your hands.3/5
We're getting better at testing.This crisis is so difficult because the enemy is invisible.The answer is to remove the cloak of invisibility to identify the virus, and to be able to know which of us is carrying it and who has actually had it and got over it.2/5
We can send #coronavirus packing in this country, but only if we take the required steps to reduce the peak.Once we've achieved that, then the scientific progress that we are making will really come into play.1/5
I want to say a huge thank you on behalf of the whole country to everyone working in our NHS, of every specialism and role, in our fight against the coronavirus pandemic. We've never needed you more than we do today.
