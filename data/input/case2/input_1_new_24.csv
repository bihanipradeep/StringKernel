These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day thatthe LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn,
and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which wereanointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office.
And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offeredstrange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they hadno children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office
in the sight of Aaron their father.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 3:6 Bring the tribe of Levinear, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister
unto him.And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the wholecongregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the
service of the tabernacle.And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of thecongregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the
service of the tabernacle.And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: theyare wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.
And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait ontheir priest’s office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be putto death.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 3:12 And I, behold, I havetaken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all thefirstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel:
therefore the Levites shall be mine; 3:13 Because all the firstbornare mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land ofEgypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and
beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD.And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by
their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thounumber them.And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he

And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families;Libni, and Shimei.And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar,

Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of allthe males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numberedof them were seven thousand and five hundred.
The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernaclewestward.And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall
be Eliasaph the son of Lael.And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of thecongregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering
thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation, 3:26 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain forthe door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar
round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family ofthe Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of

before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses,and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for thecharge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh

all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and twothousand.And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the
males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and takethe number of their names.And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of
all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of theLevites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the childrenof Israel.
And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstbornamong the children of Israel.And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month
old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty andtwo thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 3:45 Take the Levites
instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and thecattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shallbe mine: I am the LORD.
And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred andthreescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel,which are more than the Levites; 3:47 Thou shalt even take five
shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shaltthou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:) 3:48 And thou shaltgive the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed,
unto Aaron and to his sons.And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over andabove them that were redeemed by the Levites: 3:50 Of the firstborn of
the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred andthreescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 3:51And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to
his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commandedMoses.And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 4:2 Take the
sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after theirfamilies, by the house of their fathers, 4:3 From thirty years old andupward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do
the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacleof the congregation, about the most holy things: 4:5 And when the camp
setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall takedown the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it: 4:6And shall put thereon the covering of badgers’ skins, and shall spread
over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue,and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers
to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon: 4:8 Andthey shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the samewith a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put in the staves
thereof.And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick ofthe light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all
the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it: 4:10 Andthey shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering ofbadgers’ skins, and shall put it upon a bar.
And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, andcover it with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put to thestaves thereof: 4:12 And they shall take all the instruments of
ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in acloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers’ skins, andshall put them on a bar: 4:13 And they shall take away the ashes from
the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon: 4:14 And they shall putupon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it,even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all
the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering ofbadgers’ skins, and put to the staves of it.And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to setforward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: butthey shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are
the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of thecongregation.And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the dailymeat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all thetabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the
vessels thereof.And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying, 4:18 Cut yenot off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the
Levites: 4:19 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die,when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shallgo in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:
But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered,lest they die.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 4:22 Take also the sum of
the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by theirfamilies; 4:23 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years oldshalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to
do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve,and for burdens: 4:25 And they shall bear the curtains of the
tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, andthe covering of the badgers’ skins that is above upon it, and thehanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 4:26 And
the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate ofthe court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about,and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all
that is made for them: so shall they serve.At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the serviceof the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their
service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in thetabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the
hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after theirfamilies, by the house of their fathers; 4:30 From thirty years old
and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every onethat entereth into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle ofthe congregation.
And this is the charge of their burden, according to all theirservice in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of thetabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets
thereof, 4:32 And the pillars of the court round about, and theirsockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the
instruments of the charge of their burden.This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation,
under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numberedthe sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house
of their fathers, 4:35 From thirty years old and upward even untofifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for thework in the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:36 And those that were
numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred andfifty.These were they that were numbered of the families of the
Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of thecongregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to thecommandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughouttheir families, and by the house of their fathers, 4:39 From thirtyyears old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that
entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of thecongregation, 4:40 Even those that were numbered of them, throughouttheir families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and
six hundred and thirty.These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons ofGershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to thecommandment of the LORD.And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, 4:43From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every onethat entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the
congregation, 4:44 Even those that were numbered of them after theirfamilies, were three thousand and two hundred.These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of theLORD by the hand of Moses.All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron
and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after thehouse of their fathers, 4:47 From thirty years old and upward evenunto fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the
ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of thecongregation.Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and
five hundred and fourscore, 4:49 According to the commandment of theLORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one according tohis service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of
him, as the LORD commanded Moses.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:2 Command the children ofIsrael, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that
hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead: 5:3 Both male andfemale shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that theydefile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.
And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without thecamp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:6 Speak unto the children
of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit,to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty; 5:7 Thenthey shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall
recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto itthe fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hathtrespassed.
But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto,let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest;beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made
for him.And every offering of all the holy things of the children ofIsrael, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.
And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any mangiveth the priest, it shall be his.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:12 Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man’s wife go aside, andcommit a trespass against him, 5:13 And a man lie with her carnally,and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she
be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be takenwith the manner; 5:14 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and hebe jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of
jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be notdefiled: 5:15 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, andhe shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of
barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincensethereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial,bringing iniquity to remembrance.
And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and ofthe dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take,
and put it into the water: 5:18 And the priest shall set the womanbefore the LORD, and uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering ofmemorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest
shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse: 5:19And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, Ifno man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to
uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free fromthis bitter water that causeth the curse: 5:20 But if thou hast goneaside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and
some man have lain with thee beside thine husband: 5:21 Then thepriest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priestshall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among
thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly toswell; 5:22 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thybowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the
woman shall say, Amen, amen.And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shallblot them out with the bitter water: 5:24 And he shall cause the woman
to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water thatcauseth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offerit upon the altar: 5:26 And the priest shall take an handful of theoffering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and
afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall cometo pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her
husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her,and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot:and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall befree, and shall conceive seed.This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another
instead of her husband, and is defiled; 5:30 Or when the spirit ofjealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shallset the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her
all this law.Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this womanshall bear her iniquity.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 Speak unto the childrenof Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separatethemselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the
LORD: 6:3 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, andshall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neithershall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is madeof the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor
come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which heseparateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let thelocks of the hair of his head grow.
All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shallcome at no dead body.He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because theconsecration of his God is upon his head.All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.
And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled thehead of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day ofhis cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two youngpigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation: 6:11 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin
offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonementfor him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his headthat same day.
And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation,and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: butthe days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was
defiled.And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of hisseparation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation: 6:14 And he shall offer his offeringunto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for aburnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for
a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings, 6:15And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled withoil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat
offering, and their drink offerings.And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offerhis sin offering, and his burnt offering: 6:17 And he shall offer the
ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basketof unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering,and his drink offering.
And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair ofthe head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the
sacrifice of the peace offerings.And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and oneunleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall
put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of hisseparation is shaven: 6:20 And the priest shall wave them for a waveoffering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave
breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of hisoffering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand
shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do afterthe law of his separation.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:23 Speak unto Aaron and
unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children ofIsrael, saying unto them, 6:24 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
thee: 6:26 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give theepeace.And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I
will bless them.And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up thetabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the
instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, andhad anointed them, and sanctified them; 7:2 That the princes ofIsrael, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of
the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered: 7:3 Andthey brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, andtwelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox:
and they brought them before the tabernacle.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:5 Take it of them, thatthey may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation;
and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according tohis service.And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
Levites.Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,according to their service: 7:8 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave
unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the handof Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of
the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon theirshoulders.And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day
that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering beforethe altar.And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering,

from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony, frombetween the two cherubims: and he spake unto him.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Speak unto Aaron and
say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall givelight over against the candlestick.And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the
candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto theshaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according
unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made thecandlestick.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:6 Take the Levites from
among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle waterof purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let
them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, evenfine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take
for a sin offering.And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of thecongregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children
of Israel together: 8:10 And thou shalt bring the Levites before theLORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon theLevites: 8:11 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an
offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the serviceof the LORD.And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and theother for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement forthe Levites.
And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of
Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of thetabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer
them for an offering.For they are wholly given unto me from among the children ofIsrael; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the
firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, bothman and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of
Egypt I sanctified them for myself.And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of thechildren of Israel.
And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sonsfrom among the children of Israel, to do the service of the childrenof Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an
atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague amongthe children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto thesanctuary.
And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children ofIsrael, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commandedMoses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.
And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; andAaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made anatonement for them to cleanse them.
And after that went the Levites in to do their service in thetabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: asthe LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto
them.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:24 This is it thatbelongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward
they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of thecongregation: 8:25 And from the age of fifty years they shall ceasewaiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more: 8:26 But
shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of thecongregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shaltthou do unto the Levites touching their charge.
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in thefirst month of the second year after they were come out of the land ofEgypt, saying, 9:2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover
at his appointed season.In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it inhis appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according
to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keepthe passover.
And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the firstmonth at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that theLORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of aman, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they camebefore Moses and before Aaron on that day: 9:7 And those men said unto
him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we keptback, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointedseason among the children of Israel?  9:8 And Moses said unto them,
Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerningyou.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 9:10 Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterityshall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afaroff, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.
The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keepit, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone
of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keepit.But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and
forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut offfrom among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORDin his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep thepassover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover,and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one
ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in theland.And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at eventhere was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, untilthe morning.
So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearanceof fire by night.And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after
that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where thecloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,
and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloudabode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyednot.And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;
according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents,and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,
and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, theyjourneyed.
Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that thecloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children ofIsrael abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken
up, they journeyed.At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and atthe commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of
the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10:2 Make thee twotrumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou
mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for thejourneying of the camps.And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall
assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation.And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which
are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves untothee.When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts
shall go forward.When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie onthe south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for
their journeys.But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shallblow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout yourgenerations.
And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy thatoppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and yeshall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved
from your enemies.Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, andin the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over
your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORDyour God.
And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, inthe second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacleof the testimony.
And the children of Israel took their journeys out of thewilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.And they first took their journey according to the commandment
of the LORD by the hand of Moses.In the first place went the standard of the camp of the childrenof Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the
son of Amminadab.And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar wasNethaneel the son of Zuar.
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun wasEliab the son of Helon.And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and
the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according totheir armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon wasShelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
Eliasaph the son of Deuel.And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and theother did set up the tabernacle against they came.
And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim setforward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama theson of Ammihud.
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh wasGamaliel the son of Pedahzur.And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
Abidan the son of Gideoni.And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and
over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher wasPagiel the son of Ocran.
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali wasAhira the son of Enan.Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to
their armies, when they set forward.And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,Moses’ father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the
LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do theegood: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
own land, and to my kindred.And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thouknowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to
us instead of eyes.And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that whatgoodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.
And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them inthe three days’ journey, to search out a resting place for them.
And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they wentout of the camp.And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,
Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them thathate thee flee before thee.And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
thousands of Israel.And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and theLORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD
burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost partsof the camp.And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
LORD, the fire was quenched.And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire ofthe LORD burnt among them.
And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: andthe children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give usflesh to eat?  11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt
freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,and the garlick: 11:6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothingat all, beside this manna, before our eyes.
And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof asthe colour of bdellium.And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes ofit: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
upon it.Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was
kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thyservant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou
layest the burden of all this people upon me?  11:12 Have I conceivedall this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say untome, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking
child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  11:13Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weepunto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is tooheavy for me.And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see mywretchedness.And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of thecongregation, that they may stand there with thee.
And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will takeof the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and theyshall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not
thyself alone.And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the
LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with usin Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
ten days, nor twenty days; 11:20 But even a whole month, until it comeout at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that yehave despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him,
saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?  11:21 And Moses said, Thepeople, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thouhast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to sufficethem?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,to suffice them?  11:23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD’s
hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come topass unto thee or not.And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set themround about the tabernacle.And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took
of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders:and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, theyprophesied, and did not cease.
But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of theone was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit restedupon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out
unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad andMedad do prophesy in the camp.
And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of hisyoung men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
that all the LORD’s people were prophets, and that the LORD would puthis spirit upon them!  11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he andthe elders of Israel.
And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quailsfrom the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day’sjourney on this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other
side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon theface of the earth.And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered leastgathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselvesround about the camp.
And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it waschewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and theLORD smote the people with a very great plague.
And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: becausethere they buried the people that lusted.And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
and abode at Hazeroth.And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopianwoman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.
And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath henot spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
upon the face of the earth.)  12:4 And the LORD spake suddenly untoMoses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto thetabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.
And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood inthe door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they bothcame forth.
And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speakunto him in a dream.
My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not indark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold:
wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and hedeparted.
And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam,and, behold, she was leprous.
And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, laynot the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein wehave sinned.
Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumedwhen he cometh out of his mother’s womb.And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
beseech thee.And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in herface, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from
the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the peoplejourneyed not till Miriam was brought in again.
And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched inthe wilderness of Paran.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Send thou men, that
they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children ofIsrael: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every onea ruler among them.
And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from thewilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children ofIsrael.
And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua theson of Zaccur.Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
land.And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto
them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleththerein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 13:19 And what
the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and whatcities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strongholds; 13:20 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether
there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring ofthe fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripegrapes.
So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness ofZin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebronwas built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  13:23 And they came untothe brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one
cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and theybrought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of
grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all thecongregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.
And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thousentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is thefruit of it.
Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, andthe cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw thechildren of Anak there.
The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and theCanaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us goup at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up
against the people; for they are stronger than we.And they brought up an evil report of the land which they hadsearched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which
we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitantsthereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a greatstature.
And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of thegiants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we werein their sight.
And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; andthe people wept that night.And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that wehad died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in thiswilderness!  14:3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this
land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should bea prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?  14:4 And theysaid one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into
Egypt.Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assemblyof the congregation of the children of Israel.
And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, whichwere of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 14:7 And theyspake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The

Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people ofthe land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed fromthem, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.
But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And theglory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregationbefore all the children of Israel.
And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provokeme?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signswhich I have shewed among them?  14:12 I will smite them with the
