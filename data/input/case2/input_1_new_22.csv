And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of thetabernacle of the congregation, saying, 1:2 Speak unto the children ofIsrael, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering untothe LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the
herd, and of the flock.If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer amale without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; andit shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood roundabout upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation.And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,
and lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 And the priests, Aaron’ssons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon thewood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 But his inwards
and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all onthe altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of asweet savour unto the LORD.
And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or ofthe goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male withoutblemish.
And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward beforethe LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his bloodround about upon the altar.
And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the firewhich is upon the altar: 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the
legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it uponthe altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of asweet savour unto the LORD.
And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be offowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of youngpigeons.
And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off hishead, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrungout at the side of the altar: 1:16 And he shall pluck away his crop
with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, bythe place of the ashes: 1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wingsthereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it
upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burntsacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his
offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, andput frankincense thereon: 2:2 And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sonsthe priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour
thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be anoffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: 2:3 And the
remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is athing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, orunleavened wafers anointed with oil.And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be
of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meatoffering.
And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, itshall be made of fine flour with oil.And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these
things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, heshall bring it unto the altar.And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made byfire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and
his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD madeby fire.No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in anyoffering of the LORD made by fire.As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto
the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season withsalt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to
be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shaltoffer salt.And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits greenears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it
is a meat offering.And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beatencorn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense
thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offerit of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it
without blemish before the LORD.And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and killit at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons
the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering anoffering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the

And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by theflanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall hetake away.
And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food ofthe offering made by fire unto the LORD.And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the
LORD.And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it beforethe tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall
sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made byfire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat
that is upon the inwards, 3:15 And the two kidneys, and the fat thatis upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver,with the kidneys, it shall he take away.
And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food ofthe offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is theLORD’s.
It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughoutall your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 4:2 Speak unto the children
of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against anyof the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not tobe done, and shall do against any of them: 4:3 If the priest that is
anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bringfor his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemishunto the LORD for a sin offering.
And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon thebullock’s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.
And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood,and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:6 And the priestshall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven
times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of thealtar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of
the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at thebottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of thetabernacle of the congregation.
And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for thesin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat thatis upon the inwards, 4:9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon
them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with thekidneys, it shall he take away, 4:10 As it was taken off from thebullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn
them upon the altar of the burnt offering.And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 4:12 Even the whole
bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place,where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire:where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.
And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have donesomewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things
which should not be done, and are guilty; 4:14 When the sin, whichthey have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shalloffer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle
of the congregation.And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon thehead of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed
before the LORD.And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock’sblood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:17 And the priest shall
dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven timesbefore the LORD, even before the vail.And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of thecongregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of thealtar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation.And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon thealtar.
And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for asin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make anatonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.
And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burnhim as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for thecongregation.
When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignoranceagainst any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning thingswhich should not be done, and is guilty; 4:23 Or if his sin, wherein
he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, akid of the goats, a male without blemish: 4:24 And he shall lay hishand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they
kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering withhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burntoffering.And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the
sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonementfor him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while
he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORDconcerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty; 4:28 Orif his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall
bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, forhis sin which he hath sinned.And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall
pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is takenaway from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall

and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of thelamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the
priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings madeby fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for hissin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.
And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is awitness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,then he shall bear his iniquity.
Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase ofan unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase ofunclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall
be unclean, and guilty.Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness itbe that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he
knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to dogood, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it
be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in oneof these.And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,
that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 5:6 And heshall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which hehath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,
for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for himconcerning his sin.And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his
trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two youngpigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for aburnt offering.
And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer thatwhich is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from hisneck, but shall not divide it asunder: 5:9 And he shall sprinkle of
the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the restof the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is asin offering.
And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according tothe manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sinwhich he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two youngpigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenthpart of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil
upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is asin offering.Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take
his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sinoffering.
And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching hissin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him:and the remnant shall be the priest’s, as a meat offering.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:15 If a soul commit atrespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD;then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without
blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto thepriest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram ofthe trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which areforbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wistit not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, withthy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and thepriest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance
wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed againstthe LORD.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 If a soul sin, andcommit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in thatwhich was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken
away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 6:3 Or have foundthat which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; inany of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 6:4 Then it shall
be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore thatwhich he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfullygotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing
which he found, 6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; heshall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth partmore thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day
of his trespass offering.And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ramwithout blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass
offering, unto the priest: 6:7 And the priest shall make an atonementfor him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing ofall that he hath done in trespassing therein.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:9 Command Aaron and hissons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burntoffering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the
morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linenbreeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the
fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shallput them beside the altar.And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and
carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall notbe put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and
lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon thefat of the peace offerings.The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go
out.And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shalloffer it before the LORD, before the altar.
And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meatoffering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which isupon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet
savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: withunleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of
the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them fortheir portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the
sin offering, and as the trespass offering.All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. Itshall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shallbe holy.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:20 This is the offering
of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in theday when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour fora meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof
at night.In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thoushalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt
thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shalloffer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly
burnt.For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: itshall not be eaten.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron andto his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the placewhere the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed
before the LORD: it is most holy.The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holyplace shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the
congregation.Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and whenthere is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt
wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: andif it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed
in water.All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is mostholy.
And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into thetabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.
Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is mostholy.In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill
the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle roundabout upon the altar.And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the
fat that covereth the inwards, 7:4 And the two kidneys, and the fatthat is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is abovethe liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 7:5 And the priest
shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto theLORD: it is a trespass offering.Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten
in the holy place: it is most holy.As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is onelaw for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have
it.And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, even thepriest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he
hath offered.And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all thatis dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s
that offereth it.And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all thesons of Aaron have, one as much as another.
And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which heshall offer unto the LORD.If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, andunleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, offine flour, fried.
Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened breadwith the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest’s thatsprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shallnot leave any of it until the morning.But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth hissacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
shall be burnt with fire.And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offeringsbe eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither
shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be anabomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;
it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be cleanshall eat thereof.But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness uponhim, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable uncleanthing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, whichpertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his
people.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:23 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or
of sheep, or of goat.And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat ofthat which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye
shall in no wise eat of it.For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer anoffering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it
shall be cut off from his people.Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowlor of beast, in any of your dwellings.
Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even thatsoul shall be cut off from his people.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:29 Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of hispeace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORDof the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may bewaved for a wave offering before the LORD.
And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breastshall be Aaron’s and his sons’.And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave
offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peaceofferings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.
For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of thechildren of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a
statute for ever from among the children of Israel.This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of theanointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire,
in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in thepriest’s office; 7:36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of thechildren of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for
ever throughout their generations.This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, andof the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the
consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 7:38 Whichthe LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commandedthe children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the
wilderness of Sinai.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Take Aaron and his sonswith him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for
the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 8:3And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of thetabernacle of the congregation.
And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly wasgathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the
LORD commanded to be done.And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and
clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girdedhim with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto himtherewith.
And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in thebreastplate the Urim and the Thummim.And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon
his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as theLORD commanded Moses.And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and
all that was therein, and sanctified them.And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointedthe altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to
sanctify them.And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, andanointed him, to sanctify him.
And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, andgirded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORDcommanded Moses.
And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron andhis sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sinoffering.
And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon thehorns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified thealtar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified
it, to make reconciliation upon it.And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caulabove the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned
it upon the altar.But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burntwith fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.
And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and hissons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
round about.And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and thepieces, and the fat.
And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burntthe whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweetsavour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD
