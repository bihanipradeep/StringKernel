When forty winters shall beseige thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,
Proving his beauty by succession thine!
This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still
While comments of your praise, richly compil'd
[Rehearse thy] character with golden quill
And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
I think good thoughts while others write good words
And, like unletter'd clerk, still cry 'Amen
To every hymn that able spirit affords
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
Hearing you praised, I say "'Tis so, 'tis true,"
And to the most of praise add something more
But that is in my thought, whose love to you
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
Then others for the breath of words respect
Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
My bonds in thee are all determinate.
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
And for that riches where is my deserving?
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
And so my patent back again is swerving.
Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing
Comes home again, on better judgment making.
Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
That you were once unkind, befriends me now
And for that sorrow, which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
As I by yours, y' have pass'd a hell of time
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.
O, that our night of woe might have remember'd
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits
And soon to you, as you to me, then tendered
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits!
But that your trespass now becomes a fee
Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantise of skill
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
O, though I love what others do abhor
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me
More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
The little Love-god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
This brand she quenched in a cool well by
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall
Came there for cure, and this by that I prove
Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
