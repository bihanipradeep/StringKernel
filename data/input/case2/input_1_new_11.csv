Enter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners.FLAVIUS. Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.Is this a holiday? What, know you not,Being mechanical, you ought not walkUpon a laboring day without the sign
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?FIRST COMMONER. Why, sir, a carpenter.MARULLUS. Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
You, sir, what trade are you?SECOND COMMONER. Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I ambut, as you would say, a cobbler.MARULLUS. But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
SECOND COMMONER. A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safeconscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.MARULLUS. What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?SECOND COMMONER. Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet,
if you be out, sir, I can mend you.MARULLUS. What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!SECOND COMMONER. Why, sir, cobble you.FLAVIUS. Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
SECOND COMMONER. Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; Imeddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with awl.I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are ingreat danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.FLAVIUS. But wherefore art not in thy shop today?Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?SECOND COMMONER. Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself
into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesarand to rejoice in his triumph.MARULLUS. Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?What tributaries follow him to Rome
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,Your infants in your arms, and there have satThe livelong day with patient expectation
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.And when you saw his chariot but appear,Have you not made an universal shoutThat Tiber trembled underneath her banks
To hear the replication of your soundsMade in her concave shores?And do you now put on your best attire?And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his wayThat comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?Be gone!Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plagueThat needs must light on this ingratitude.FLAVIUS. Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,Assemble all the poor men of your sort,
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tearsInto the channel, till the lowest streamDo kiss the most exalted shores of all.Exeunt all Commoners.
See whether their basest metal be not moved;They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.Go you down that way towards the Capitol;This way will I. Disrobe the images
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.MARULLUS. May we do so?You know it is the feast of Lupercal.FLAVIUS. It is no matter; let no images
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll aboutAnd drive away the vulgar from the streets;So do you too, where you perceive them thick.These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,Who else would soar above the view of menAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness.              Exeunt.Flourish. Enter Caesar; Antony, for the course; Calpurnia, Portia,
Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and Casca; a great crowd follows,among them a Soothsayer.CAESAR. Calpurnia!CASCA. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
Music ceases.CAESAR. Calpurnia!CALPURNIA. Here, my lord.CAESAR. Stand you directly in Antonio's way,
When he doth run his course. Antonio!ANTONY. Caesar, my lord?CAESAR. Forget not in your speed, Antonio,To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say
The barren, touched in this holy chase,Shake off their sterile curse.ANTONY. I shall remember.When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform'd.
CAESAR. Set on, and leave no ceremony out Flourish.SOOTHSAYER. Caesar!CAESAR. Ha! Who calls?CASCA. Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!
CAESAR. Who is it in the press that calls on me?I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,Cry "Caesar." Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR. What man is that?BRUTUS. A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.CAESAR. Set him before me let me see his face.CASSIUS. Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
CAESAR. What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.CAESAR. He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.Sennet. Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius.
CASSIUS. Will you go see the order of the course?BRUTUS. Not I.CASSIUS. I pray you, do.BRUTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;I'll leave you.CASSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
I have not from your eyes that gentlenessAnd show of love as I was wont to have;You bear too stubborn and too strange a handOver your friend that loves you.
BRUTUS. Cassius,Be not deceived; if I have veil'd my look,I turn the trouble of my countenanceMerely upon myself. Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference,Conceptions only proper to myself,Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-
Among which number, Cassius, be you one-Nor construe any further my neglectThan that poor Brutus with himself at warForgets the shows of love to other men.
CASSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,By means whereof this breast of mine hath buriedThoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
BRUTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itselfBut by reflection, by some other things.CASSIUS. 'Tis just,And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turnYour hidden worthiness into your eyeThat you might see your shadow. I have heardWhere many of the best respect in Rome,
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of BrutusAnd groaning underneath this age's yoke,Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.BRUTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myselfFor that which is not in me?CASSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I your glassWill modestly discover to yourselfThat of yourself which you yet know not of.And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;
Were I a common laugher, or did useTo stale with ordinary oaths my loveTo every new protester, if you knowThat I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them, or if you knowThat I profess myself in banquetingTo all the rout, then hold me dangerous.Flourish and shout.
BRUTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the peopleChoose Caesar for their king.CASSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?Then must I think you would not have it so.
BRUTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.But wherefore do you hold me here so long?What is it that you would impart to me?If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honor in one eye and death i' the otherAnd I will look on both indifferently.For let the gods so speed me as I loveThe name of honor more than I fear death.
CASSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,As well as I do know your outward favor.Well, honor is the subject of my story.I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life, but, for my single self,I had as lief not be as live to beIn awe of such a thing as I myself.I was born free as Caesar, so were you;
We both have fed as well, and we can bothEndure the winter's cold as well as he.For once, upon a raw and gusty day,The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius, nowLeap in with me into this angry floodAnd swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,Enter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners.FLAVIUS. Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.
Is this a holiday? What, know you not,Being mechanical, you ought not walkUpon a laboring day without the signOf your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
