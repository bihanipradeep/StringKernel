Either to die the death, or to abjureFor ever the society of men.Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,Know of your youth, examine well your blood,Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,To live a barren sister all your life,Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessèd they that master so their bloodTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage,But earthlier happy is the rose distill’dThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,
Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.HERMIA.So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwishèd yokeMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.THESEUS.Take time to pause; and by the next new moon
The sealing-day betwixt my love and meFor everlasting bond of fellowship,Upon that day either prepare to dieFor disobedience to your father’s will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,Or on Diana’s altar to protestFor aye austerity and single life.DEMETRIUS.
Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yieldThy crazèd title to my certain right.LYSANDER.You have her father’s love, Demetrius.
Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.EGEUS.Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;And what is mine my love shall render him;
And she is mine, and all my right of herI do estate unto Demetrius.LYSANDER.I am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,
As well possess’d; my love is more than his;My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,If not with vantage, as Demetrius’;And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.Why should not I then prosecute my right?Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,Upon this spotted and inconstant man.THESEUS.
I must confess that I have heard so much,And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;But, being over-full of self-affairs,My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.I have some private schooling for you both.—For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourselfTo fit your fancies to your father’s will,
Or else the law of Athens yields you up(Which by no means we may extenuate)To death, or to a vow of single life.Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go along;I must employ you in some businessAgainst our nuptial, and confer with youOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.
EGEUS.With duty and desire we follow you.[Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia.]LYSANDER.
How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?How chance the roses there do fade so fast?HERMIA.Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.LYSANDER.Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth.But either it was different in blood—HERMIA.O cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.
LYSANDER.Or else misgraffèd in respect of years—HERMIA.O spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.
LYSANDER.Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—HERMIA.O hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!
LYSANDER.Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,Making it momentany as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,Brief as the lightning in the collied nightThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,And, ere a man hath power to say, ‘Behold!’
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:So quick bright things come to confusion.HERMIA.If then true lovers have ever cross’d,
It stands as an edict in destiny.Then let us teach our trial patience,Because it is a customary cross,As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.LYSANDER.A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Of great revenue, and she hath no child.From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,And she respects me as her only son.There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,
And to that place the sharp Athenian lawCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;And in the wood, a league without the town
(Where I did meet thee once with HelenaTo do observance to a morn of May),There will I stay for thee.HERMIA.
My good Lysander!I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,By his best arrow with the golden head,By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,And by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queenWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,By all the vows that ever men have broke
(In number more than ever women spoke),In that same place thou hast appointed me,Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.LYSANDER.
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.Enter Helena.HERMIA.God speed fair Helena! Whither away?
HELENA.Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.Sickness is catching. O were favour so,Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,The rest I’d give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look, and with what artYou sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!HERMIA.I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
HELENA.O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!HERMIA.I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
HELENA.O that my prayers could such affection move!HERMIA.The more I hate, the more he follows me.
HELENA.The more I love, the more he hateth me.HERMIA.His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
HELENA.None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!HERMIA.Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
Lysander and myself will fly this place.Before the time I did Lysander see,Seem’d Athens as a paradise to me.O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn’d a heaven into hell!LYSANDER.Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass,Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),Through Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.
HERMIA.And in the wood where often you and IUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
There my Lysander and myself shall meet,And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,To seek new friends and stranger companies.Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sightFrom lovers’ food, till morrow deep midnight.LYSANDER.
I will, my Hermia.[Exit Hermia.]Helena, adieu.As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
[Exit Lysander.]HELENA.How happy some o’er other some can be!Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;He will not know what all but he do know.And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,So I, admiring of his qualities.
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,Love can transpose to form and dignity.Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste.Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.And therefore is love said to be a child,Because in choice he is so oft beguil’d.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,So the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere.For, ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,He hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,So he dissolv’d, and showers of oaths did melt.I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.Then to the wood will he tomorrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligenceIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.But herein mean I to enrich my pain,To have his sight thither and back again.
