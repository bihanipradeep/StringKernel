Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which cameinto Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, andBenjamin,  Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increasedabundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land
was filled with them.Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children ofIsrael are more and mightier than we: 1:10 Come on, let us deal wisely
with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when therefalleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fightagainst us, and so get them up out of the land.Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom andRaamses.But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied andgrew.
And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve withrigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, inmorter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all
their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which thename of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 Andhe said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and
see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: butif it be a daughter, then she shall live.But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egyptcommanded them, but saved the men children alive.
And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said untothem, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men childrenalive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrewwomen are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are
delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the peoplemultiplied, and waxed very mighty.And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
made them houses.And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that isborn ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall savealive.
And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife adaughter of Levi.And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him thathe was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark ofbulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the childtherein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at theriver; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when shesaw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the
babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of theHebrews’ children.Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call tothee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for
thee?  2:8 And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid wentand called the child’s mother.And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, andnurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took
the child, and nursed it.And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter,and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,Because I drew him out of the water.
And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that hewent out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spiedan Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there
was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of theHebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee a
prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thoukilledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thingis known.Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:and he sat down by a well.Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came anddrew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood upand helped them, and watered their flock.And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it thatye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered
us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough forus, and watered the flock.And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it thatye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave MosesZipporah his daughter.And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for hesaid, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egyptdied: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, andthey cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respectunto them.Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest
of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, andcame to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire outof the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned
with fire, and the bush was not consumed.And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,why the bush is not burnt.And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto
him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,Here am I.And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thyfeet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for hewas afraid to look upon God.And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people
which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of theirtaskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down todeliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them upout of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing
with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and theHittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, andthe Jebusites.Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come
unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptiansoppress them.Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thoumayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be atoken unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth
the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children ofIsrael, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent meunto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say
unto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent meunto you.And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this ismy name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,
The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and ofJacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seenthat which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bringyou up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,
and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and theHivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thouand the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say
unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let usgo, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that wemay sacrifice to the LORD our God.And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not
by a mighty hand.And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all mywonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he willlet you go.
And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her thatsojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon yourdaughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believeme, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not
appeared unto thee.And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And hesaid, A rod.And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,
and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it bythe tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became arod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their
fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,hath appeared unto thee.And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand intothy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it
out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put hishand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.
