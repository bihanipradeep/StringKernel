And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,Shew'd like a Rebells Whore: but all's too weake:For braue Macbeth (well hee deserues that Name)Disdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,
Which smoak'd with bloody execution(Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,Till hee fac'd the Slaue:Which neu'r shooke hands, nor bad farwell to him,
Till he vnseam'd him from the Naue toth' Chops,And fix'd his Head vpon our BattlementsKing. O valiant Cousin, worthy GentlemanCap. As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection,
Shipwracking Stormes, and direfull Thunders:So from that Spring, whence comfort seem'd to come,Discomfort swells: Marke King of Scotland, marke,No sooner Iustice had, with Valour arm'd,
Compell'd these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles,But the Norweyan Lord, surueying vantage,With furbusht Armes, and new supplyes of men,Began a fresh assault

If I say sooth, I must report they wereAs Cannons ouer-charg'd with double Cracks,So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe:Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,

But how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liuesA prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,Stands not within the prospect of beleefe,No more then to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange Intelligence, or whyVpon this blasted Heath you stop our wayWith such Prophetique greeting?Speake, I charge you.
Witches vanish.Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,And these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,

In which addition, haile most worthy Thane,For it is thineBanq. What, can the Deuill speake true?Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:
Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,Which he deserues to loose.
Whether he was combin'd with those of Norway,Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,And vantage; or that with both he labour'dIn his Countreyes wracke, I know not:
But Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,Haue ouerthrowne himMacb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:The greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.
Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,Promis'd no lesse to themBanq. That trusted home,
Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,
Winne vs with honest Trifles, to betray'sIn deepest consequence.Cousins, a word, I pray youMacb. Two Truths are told,
As happy Prologues to the swelling ActOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:This supernaturall sollicitingCannot be ill; cannot be good.
If ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,Commencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,
And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,Against the vse of Nature? Present FearesAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,
Shakes so my single state of Man,That Function is smother'd in surmise,And nothing is, but what is notBanq. Looke how our Partner's rapt

But I haue spoke with one that saw him die:Who did report, that very frankly heeConfess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,And set forth a deepe Repentance:
Nothing in his Life became him,Like the leauing it. Hee dy'de,As one that had beene studied in his death,To throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,
As 'twere a carelesse TrifleKing. There's no Art,To finde the Mindes construction in the Face.He was a Gentleman, on whom I built
An absolute Trust.Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.O worthyest Cousin,The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now
Was heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,To ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,That the proportion both of thanks, and payment,
Might haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,More is thy due, then more then all can payMacb. The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,In doing it, payes it selfe.
Your Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:And our Duties are to your Throne, and State,Children, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue
And HonorKing. Welcome hither:I haue begun to plant thee, and will labourTo make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
That hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowneNo lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,And hold thee to my HeartBanq. There if I grow,

King. My worthy CawdorMacb. The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,On which I must fall downe, or else o're-leape,For in my way it lyes. Starres hide your fires,
Let not Light see my black and deepe desires:The Eye winke at the Hand: yet let that bee,Which the Eye feares, when it is done to see.Enter.
King. True worthy Banquo: he is full so valiant,And in his commendations, I am fed:It is a Banquet to me. Let's after him,Whose care is gone before, to bid vs welcome:

Lady. They met me in the day of successe: and I hauelearn'd by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, thenmortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question themfurther, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues fromthe King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Titlebefore, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me tothe comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This
haue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner ofGreatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycingby being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Layit to thy heart and farewell.
Glamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt beWhat thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,It is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,To catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great,
Art not without Ambition, but withoutThe illnesse should attend it. What thou would'st highly,That would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,And yet would'st wrongly winne.
Thould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes,Thus thou must doe, if thou haue it;And that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,Then wishest should be vndone. High thee hither,
That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare,And chastise with the valour of my TongueAll that impeides thee from the Golden Round,Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme
To haue thee crown'd withall.Enter Messenger.What is your tidings?Mess. The King comes here to Night
Lady. Thou'rt mad to say it.Is not thy Master with him? who, wer't so,Would haue inform'd for preparationMess. So please you, it is true: our Thane is comming:
One of my fellowes had the speed of him;Who almost dead for breath, had scarcely moreThen would make vp his MessageLady. Giue him tending,
He brings great newes,Exit Messenger.The Rauen himselfe is hoarse,That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan
Vnder my Battlements. Come you Spirits,That tend on mortall thoughts, vnsex me here,And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe, top-fullOf direst Crueltie: make thick my blood,
Stop vp th' accesse, and passage to Remorse,That no compunctious visitings of NatureShake my fell purpose, nor keepe peace betweeneTh' effect, and hit. Come to my Womans Brests,
And take my Milke for Gall, you murth'ring Ministers,Where-euer, in your sightlesse substances,You wait on Natures Mischiefe. Come thick Night,And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell,
That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes,Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke,To cry, hold, hold.Enter Macbeth.
Great Glamys, worthy Cawdor,Greater then both, by the all-haile hereafter,Thy Letters haue transported me beyondThis ignorant present, and I feele now
The future in the instantMacb. My dearest Loue,Duncan comes here to NightLady. And when goes hence?

May reade strange matters, to beguile the time.Looke like the time, beare welcome in your Eye,Your Hand, your Tongue: looke like th' innocent flower,But be the Serpent vnder't. He that's comming,
Must be prouided for: and you shall putThis Nights great Businesse into my dispatch,Which shall to all our Nights, and Dayes to come,Giue solely soueraigne sway, and Masterdome

Macb. If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well,It were done quickly: If th' AssassinationCould trammell vp the Consequence, and catchWith his surcease, Successe: that but this blow
Might be the be all, and the end all. Heere,But heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,Wee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,We still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach
Bloody Instructions, which being taught, returneTo plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed IusticeCommends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd ChalliceTo our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;
First, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,Strong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore,Not beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane
Hath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath binSo cleere in his great Office, that his VertuesWill pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd againstThe deepe damnation of his taking off:
And Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,Striding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'dVpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,
That teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no SpurreTo pricke the sides of my intent, but onelyVaulting Ambition, which ore-leapes it selfe,And falles on th' other.
Enter Lady.How now? What Newes?La. He has almost supt: why haue you left the chamber?Mac. Hath he ask'd for me?
La. Know you not, he ha's?Mac. We will proceed no further in this Businesse:He hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue boughtGolden Opinions from all sorts of people,
Which would be worne now in their newest glosse,Not cast aside so sooneLa. Was the hope drunke,Wherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,At what it did so freely? From this time,Such I account thy loue. Art thou affear'dTo be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,
As thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue thatWhich thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?Letting I dare not, wait vpon I would,
Like the poore Cat i'th' AddageMacb. Prythee peace:I dare do all that may become a man,Who dares do more, is none
La. What Beast was't thenThat made you breake this enterprize to me?When you durst do it, then you were a man:And to be more then what you were, you would
Be so much more the man. Nor time, nor placeDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:They haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse nowDo's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know
How tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,I would, while it was smyling in my Face,Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,And dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne
As you haue done to thisMacb. If we should faile?Lady. We faile?But screw your courage to the sticking place,
