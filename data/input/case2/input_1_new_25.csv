These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this sideJordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea,between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.(There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount
Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)  1:3 And it came to pass in the fortiethyear, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Mosesspake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD
had given him in commandment unto them; 1:4 After he had slain Sihonthe king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king ofBashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 1:5 On this side Jordan, in
the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 1:6 TheLORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enoughin this mount: 1:7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the
mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in theplain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the seaside, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great
river, the river Euphrates.Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the landwhich the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to
give unto them and to their seed after them.And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bearyou myself alone: 1:10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and,
behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so manymore as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)  1:12 How can
I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among yourtribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken isgood for us to do.So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made
them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains overhundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, andofficers among your tribes.
And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causesbetween your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and hisbrother, and the stranger that is with him.
Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear thesmall as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you
bring it unto me, and I will hear it.And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye shoulddo.
And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that greatand terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain ofthe Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to
Kadeshbarnea.And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of theAmorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.
Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up andpossess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fearnot, neither be discouraged.
And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will sendmen before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring usword again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall
come.And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, oneof a tribe: 1:24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and
came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, andbrought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a
good land which the LORD our God doth give us.Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against thecommandment of the LORD your God: 1:27 And ye murmured in your tents,
and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out ofthe land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, todestroy us.
Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are greatand walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the
Anakims there.Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,
according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 1:31And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy Godbare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,
until ye came into this place.Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 1:33 Whowent in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your
tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, andin a cloud by day.And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
sware, saying, 1:35 Surely there shall not one of these men of thisevil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto yourfathers.
Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him willI give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children,because he hath wholly followed the LORD.
Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou alsoshalt not go in thither.But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall
go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, andyour children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and
evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and theyshall possess it.But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
wilderness by the way of the Red sea.Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against theLORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God
commanded us.And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were readyto go up into the hill.
And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neitherfight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against
the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out againstyou, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto
Hormah.And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would nothearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.
So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that yeabode there.Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the
way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mountSeir many days.And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 2:3 Ye have compassed this
mountain long enough: turn you northward.And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through thecoast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and
they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselvestherefore: 2:5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of theirland, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount
Seir unto Esau for a possession.Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shallalso buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thyhand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: theseforty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked
nothing.And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from
Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neithercontend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land
for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot fora possession.The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many,
and tall, as the Anakims; 2:11 Which also were accounted giants, asthe Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them,and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of hispossession, which the LORD gave unto them.
Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And wewent over the brook Zered.And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were
come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all thegeneration of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, asthe LORD sware unto them.
For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy themfrom among the host, until they were consumed.So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
dead from among the people, 2:17 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee ofthe land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have givenit unto the children of Lot for a possession.
(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt thereinin old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 2:21 A peoplegreat, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them
before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: 2:22As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when hedestroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and
dwelt in their stead even unto this day: 2:23 And the Avims whichdwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forthout of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)  2:24 Rise
ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, Ihave given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and hisland: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear ofthee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hearreport of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth untoSihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 2:27 Let me passthrough thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn
unto the right hand nor to the left.Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give mewater for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my
feet; 2:29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and theMoabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass overJordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.
But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for theLORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, thathe might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.
And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon andhis land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit hisland.
Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fightat Jahaz.And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him,
and his sons, and all his people.And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyedthe men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left
none to remain: 2:35 Only the cattle we took for a prey untoourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from
the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not onecity too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us: 2:37Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto
any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains,nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of
Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him,and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do
unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt atHeshbon.So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of
Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left tohim remaining.And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region ofArgob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
beside unwalled towns a great many.And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king ofHeshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every
city.But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for aprey to ourselves.
And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of theAmorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river ofArnon unto mount Hermon; 3:9 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion;
and the Amorites call it Shenir;) 3:10 All the cities of the plain,and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of thekingdom of Og in Bashan.
For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath ofthe children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four
cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, whichis by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof,
gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og,gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with
all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto thecoasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,
Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.And I gave Gilead unto Machir.And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead
even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even untothe river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 3:17The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth
even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgaheastward.And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath
given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed beforeyour brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I
know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which Ihave given you; 3:20 Until the LORD have given rest unto yourbrethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land
which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shallye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen
all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shallthe LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for
you.And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 3:24 O Lord GOD,thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty
hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can doaccording to thy works, and according to thy might?  3:25 I pray thee,let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that
goodly mountain, and Lebanon.But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hearme: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto
me of this matter.Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyeswestward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it
with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for heshall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit
the land which thou shalt see.So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the
judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and goin and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall
ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of theLORD your God which I command you.Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all
the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed themfrom among you.But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one
of you this day.Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORDmy God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to
possess it.Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and yourunderstanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these
statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise andunderstanding people.For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them,
as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?  4:8And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments sorighteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?  4:9 Only
take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forgetthe things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thyheart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons’
sons; 4:10 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thyGod in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the peopletogether, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to
fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and thatthey may teach their children.And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, andthick darkness.And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye
heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard avoice.And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to
perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables ofstone.And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over topossess it.Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner
of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out ofthe midst of the fire: 4:16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you agraven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or
female, 4:17 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, thelikeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 4:18 The likenessof any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish
that is in the waters beneath the earth: 4:19 And lest thou lift upthine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, andthe stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship
them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto allnations under the whole heaven.But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the
iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people ofinheritance, as ye are this day.Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware
that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in untothat good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye
shall go over, and possess that good land.Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of theLORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or
the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye
shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves,and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall doevil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: 4:26 I
call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shallsoon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan topossess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly
be destroyed.And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall beleft few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.
And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood andstone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt
find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come uponthee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and
shalt be obedient unto his voice; 4:31 (For the LORD thy God is amerciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, norforget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.
For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from theone side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such
thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?  4:33 Didever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of thefire, as thou hast heard, and live?  4:34 Or hath God assayed to go
and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, bytemptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mightyhand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to
all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD heis God; there is none else beside him.
Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he mightinstruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thouheardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seedafter them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty powerout of Egypt; 4:38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and
mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land foran inheritance, as it is this day.Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the
LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there isnone else.Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and withthy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days uponthe earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.
Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward thesunrising; 4:42 That the slayer might flee thither, which should killhis neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that
fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 4:43 Namely, Bezer inthe wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth inGilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
And this is the law which Moses set before the children ofIsrael: 4:45 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and thejudgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they
came forth out of Egypt.On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in theland of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses
and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out ofEgypt: 4:47 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king ofBashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan
toward the sunrising; 4:48 From Aroer, which is by the bank of theriver Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon, 4:49 And all theplain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain,
under the springs of Pisgah.And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel,the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that
ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
even us, who are all of us here alive this day.The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of themidst of the fire, 5:5 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time,
to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of thefire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, 5:6 I am the LORD thyGod, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
bondage.Thou shalt have none other gods before me.Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, orthat is in the waters beneath the earth: 5:9 Thou shalt not bow downthyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous
God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto thethird and fourth generation of them that hate me, 5:10 And shewingmercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for theLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath
commanded thee.Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 5:14 But theseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not
do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant,nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thycattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant
and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, andthat the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand
and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded theeto keep the sabbath day.Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath
commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may gowell with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.Thou shalt not kill.
Neither shalt thou commit adultery.Neither shalt thou steal.Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbours wife, neither shaltthou covet thy neighbours house, his field, or his manservant, or hismaidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbours.
These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mountout of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness,with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two
tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst ofthe darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near
unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 5:24 Andye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and hisgreatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire:
we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consumeus: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall
die.For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of theliving God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and
lived?  5:27 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shallsay: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak untothee; and we will hear it, and do it.
And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake untome; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words ofthis people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all
that they have spoken.O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them,
and with their children for ever!  5:30 Go say to them, Get you intoyour tents again.But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto
thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, whichthou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I givethem to possess it.
Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hathcommanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to theleft.
Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hathcommanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, andthat ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.
Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do themin the land whither ye go to possess it: 6:2 That thou mightest fear
the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, whichI command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days ofthy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.
Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may bewell with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God ofthy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and
honey.Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: 6:5 And thou shaltlove the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy might.And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thineheart: 6:7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and
shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thouwalkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thygates.
And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought theeinto the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou
buildedst not, 6:11 And houses full of all good things, which thoufilledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards andolive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and
be full; 6:12 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which broughtthee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear
by his name.Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people whichare round about you; 6:15 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among
you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, anddestroy thee from off the face of the earth.Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in
Massah.Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God,and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight ofthe LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go inand possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers.
To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hathspoken.And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean
the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORDour God hath commanded you?  6:21 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, Wewere Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt
with a mighty hand: 6:22 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, greatand sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, beforeour eyes: 6:23 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring
us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear theLORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as
it is at this day.And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all thesecommandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.
When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thougoest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, theHittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nationsgreater and mightier than thou; 7:2 And when the LORD thy God shalldeliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy
them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thoushalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy
son.For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they mayserve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against
you, and destroy thee suddenly.But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars,and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their
graven images with fire.For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thyGod hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all
people that are upon the face of the earth.The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because yewere more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all
people: 7:8 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keepthe oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD broughtyou out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of
bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God,which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his
commandments to a thousand generations; 7:10 And repayeth them thathate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to himthat hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, andthe judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these
judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keepunto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will
also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn,and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocksof thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give
thee.Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be maleor female barren among you, or among your cattle.
And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will putnone of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; butwill lay them upon all them that hate thee.
And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy Godshall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neithershalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.
If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I;how can I dispossess them?  7:18 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: butshalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto
all Egypt; 7:19 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and thesigns, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched outarm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy
God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, untilthey that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.
Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God isamong you, a mighty God and terrible.And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by
little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest thebeasts of the field increase upon thee.But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall
destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shaltdestroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to
stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thoushalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto
thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORDthy God.Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest
thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, andthou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possessthe land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led
thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to provethee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep hiscommandments, or no.
And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed theewith manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; thathe might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,these forty years.
Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chastenethhis son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to
walk in his ways, and to fear him.For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land ofbrooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys
and hills; 8:8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees,and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 8:9 A land whereinthou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing
in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thoumayest dig brass.When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD
thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping hiscommandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command
thee this day: 8:12 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hastbuilt goodly houses, and dwelt therein; 8:13 And when thy herds andthy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and
all that thou hast is multiplied; 8:14 Then thine heart be lifted up,and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of theland of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 8:15 Who led thee through
that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, andscorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought theeforth water out of the rock of flint; 8:16 Who fed thee in the
wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he mighthumble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thylatter end; 8:17 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might
of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he thatgiveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant
which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, andwalk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify
against you this day that ye shall surely perish.As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, soshall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of
the LORD your God.Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in topossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and
fenced up to heaven, 9:2 A people great and tall, the children of theAnakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who canstand before the children of Anak!  9:3 Understand therefore this day,
that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as aconsuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them downbefore thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them
quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hathcast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD
hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness ofthese nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart,
dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of thesenations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, andthat he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not thisgood land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a
stiffnecked people.Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God towrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of
the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have beenrebellious against the LORD.Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was
angry with you to have destroyed you.When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I
abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eatbread nor drink water: 9:10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tablesof stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written
according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mountout of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of thecovenant.And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt havecorrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the waywhich I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen thispeople, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 9:14 Let me alone,that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven:
and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burnedwith fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD yourGod, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly outof the way which the LORD had commanded you.
And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, andbrake them before your eyes.And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and
forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of allyour sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD,to provoke him to anger.
For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith theLORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened untome at that time also.
And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: andI prayed for Aaron also the same time.And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it
with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it wasas small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook thatdescended out of the mount.
And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, yeprovoked the LORD to wrath.Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up
and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled againstthe commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, norhearkened to his voice.
Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knewyou.Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as
I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroyyou.I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy
not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed throughthy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with amighty hand.
Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not untothe stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to theirsin: 9:28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the
LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them,and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them inthe wilderness.
Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thoubroughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone
like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make theean ark of wood.And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first
tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stonelike unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables
in mine hand.And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, theten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of
the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gavethem unto me.And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORDcommanded me.And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the
children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he wasburied; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in hisstead.
From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah toJotbath, a land of rivers of waters.At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the
ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to ministerunto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;
the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promisedhim.And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty
days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that timealso, and the LORD would not destroy thee.And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the
people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware untotheir fathers to give unto them.And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but
to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thysoul, 10:13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes,
which I command thee this day for thy good?  10:14 Behold, the heavenand the heaven of heavens is the LORD’s thy God, the earth also, withall that therein is.
Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and hechose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is thisday.
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no morestiffnecked.For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great
God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor takethreward: 10:18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless andwidow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in theland of Egypt.Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to
him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for theethese great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and tenpersons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars ofheaven for multitude.
Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which
have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORDyour God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of
Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 11:4 Andwhat he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to theirchariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as
they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto thisday; 11:5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye cameinto this place; 11:6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons
of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, andswallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all thesubstance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:
But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which hedid.Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you
this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land,whither ye go to possess it; 11:9 And that ye may prolong your days inthe land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and
to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as theland of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed,
and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 11:11 But theland, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, anddrinketh water of the rain of heaven: 11:12 A land which the LORD thy
God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, fromthe beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto
my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD yourGod, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,
the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thycorn, and thy wine, and thine oil.And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou
mayest eat and be full.Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and yeturn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 11:17 And then the
LORD’s wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, thatthere be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest yeperish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.
Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and inyour soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may beas frontlets between your eyes.
And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them whenthou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, whenthou liest down, and when thou risest up.
And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,and upon thy gates: 11:21 That your days may be multiplied, and thedays of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your
fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which Icommand you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his
ways, and to cleave unto him; 11:23 Then will the LORD drive out allthese nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nationsand mightier than yourselves.
Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall beyours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the riverEuphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.
There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORDyour God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all theland that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.
Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 11:27A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which Icommand you this day: 11:28 And a curse, if ye will not obey the
commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way whichI command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have notknown.
And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath broughtthee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thoushalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount
Ebal.Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sungoeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the
champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?  11:31 Forye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORDyour God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.
And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments whichI set before you this day.These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to
do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee topossess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations
which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, andupon the hills, and under every green tree: 12:3 And ye shalloverthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves
with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, anddestroy the names of them out of that place.Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.
But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out ofall your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shallye seek, and thither thou shalt come: 12:6 And thither ye shall bring
your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heaveofferings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings,and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: 12:7 And there ye
shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all thatye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thyGod hath blessed thee.
Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
which the LORD your God giveth you.But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORDyour God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all
your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 12:11 Then thereshall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause hisname to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you;
your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heaveoffering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto theLORD: 12:12 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and
your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and yourmaidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch ashe hath no part nor inheritance with you.
Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings inevery place that thou seest: 12:14 But in the place which the LORDshall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt
offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the
LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean mayeat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth
as water.Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, orof thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy
flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewillofferings, or heave offering of thine hand: 12:18 But thou must eatthem before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall
choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, andthy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thoushalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine
hands unto.Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long asthou livest upon the earth.
When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hathpromised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soullongeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul
lusteth after.If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his namethere be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of
thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee,and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat
them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is thelife; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.
Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth aswater.Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with
thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in thesight of the LORD.Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt
take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose: 12:27 Andthou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, uponthe altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall
be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eatthe flesh.Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it
may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, whenthou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thyGod.
When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from beforethee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them,and dwellest in their land; 12:30 Take heed to thyself that thou be
not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from beforethee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How didthese nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for everyabomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto theirgods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the
fire to their gods.What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shaltnot add thereto, nor diminish from it.
If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, andgiveth thee a sign or a wonder, 13:2 And the sign or the wonder cometo pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other
gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; 13:3 Thoushalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer ofdreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the
LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep hiscommandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave
unto him.And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put todeath; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God,
which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out ofthe house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thyGod commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from
the midst of thee.If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thydaughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine
own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve othergods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 13:7 Namely,of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee,
or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto theother end of the earth; 13:8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, norhearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou
spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 13:9 But thou shalt surely killhim; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, andafterwards the hand of all the people.
And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because hehath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which broughtthee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more anysuch wickedness as this is among you.If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy
God hath given thee to dwell there, saying, 13:13 Certain men, thechildren of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawnthe inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods,
which ye have not known; 13:14 Then shalt thou enquire, and makesearch, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thingcertain, that such abomination is wrought among you; 13:15 Thou shalt
surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword,destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattlethereof, with the edge of the sword.
And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of thestreet thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoilthereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for
ever; it shall not be built again.And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand:that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee
mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hathsworn unto thy fathers; 13:18 When thou shalt hearken to the voice ofthe LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee
this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cutyourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORDhath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all thenations that are upon the earth.
Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, andthe goat, 14:5 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the
wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleftinto two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall
eat.Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, orof them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and
the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; thereforethey are unclean unto you.And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the
cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nortouch their dead carcase.These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have
fins and scales shall ye eat: 14:10 And whatsoever hath not fins andscales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.Of all clean birds ye shall eat.
But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and theossifrage, and the ospray, 14:13 And the glede, and the kite, and thevulture after his kind, 14:14 And every raven after his kind, 14:15
And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk afterhis kind, 14:16 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 14:17And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, 14:18 And the
stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: theyshall not be eaten.
But of all clean fowls ye may eat.Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shaltgive it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or
thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people untothe LORD thy God.Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.
Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that thefield bringeth forth year by year.And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which
he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thywine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thyflocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.
And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not ableto carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thyGod shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath
