Who is sweet Fortunes Minion, and her Pride:Whil'st I by looking on the praise of him,See Ryot and Dishonor staine the browOf my yong Harry. O that it could be prou'd,
That some Night-tripping-Faiery, had exchang'dIn Cradle-clothes, our Children where they lay,And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet:Then would I haue his Harry, and he mine:

Yet heerein will I imitate the Sunne,Who doth permit the base contagious cloudesTo smother vp his Beauty from the world,That when he please againe to be himselfe,
Being wanted, he may be more wondred at,By breaking through the foule and vgly mistsOf vapours, that did seeme to strangle him.If all the yeare were playing holidaies,
To sport, would be as tedious as to worke;But when they seldome come, they wisht-for come,And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.So when this loose behauiour I throw off,
And pay the debt I neuer promised;By how much better then my word I am,By so much shall I falsifie mens hopes,And like bright Mettall on a sullen ground:
My reformation glittering o're my fault,Shall shew more goodly, and attract more eyes,Then that which hath no foyle to set it off.Ile so offend, to make offence a skill,

Those Prisoners in your Highnesse demanded,Which Harry Percy heere at Holmedon tooke,Were (as he sayes) not with such strength deniedAs was deliuered to your Maiesty:
Who either through enuy, or misprision,Was guilty of this fault; and not my SonneHot. My Liege, I did deny no Prisoners.But, I remember when the fight was done,
When I was dry with Rage, and extreame Toyle,Breathlesse, and Faint, leaning vpon my Sword,Came there a certaine Lord, neat and trimly drest;Fresh as a Bride-groome, and his Chin new reapt,
Shew'd like a stubble Land at Haruest home.He was perfumed like a Milliner,And 'twixt his Finger and his Thumbe, he heldA Pouncet-box: which euer and anon
He gaue his Nose, and took't away againe:Who therewith angry, when it next came there,Tooke it in Snuffe. And still he smil'd and talk'd:And as the Souldiers bare dead bodies by,
He call'd them vntaught Knaues, Vnmannerly,To bring a slouenly vnhandsome CoarseBetwixt the Winde, and his Nobility.With many Holiday and Lady tearme
He question'd me: Among the rest, demandedMy Prisoners, in your Maiesties behalfe.I then, all-smarting, with my wounds being cold,(To be so pestered with a Popingay)
Out of my Greefe, and my Impatience,Answer'd (neglectingly) I know not what,He should, or should not: For he made me mad,To see him shine so briske, and smell so sweet,
And talke so like a Waiting-Gentlewoman,Of Guns, & Drums, and Wounds: God saue the marke;And telling me, the Soueraign'st thing on earthWas Parmacity, for an inward bruise:
And that it was great pitty, so it was,That villanous Salt-peter should be digg'dOut of the Bowels of the harmlesse Earth,Which many a good Tall Fellow had destroy'd
So Cowardly. And but for these vile Gunnes,He would himselfe haue beene a Souldier.This bald, vnioynted Chat of his (my Lord)Made me to answer indirectly (as I said.)
And I beseech you, let not this reportCome currant for an Accusation,Betwixt my Loue, and your high MaiestyBlunt. The circumstance considered, good my Lord,
What euer Harry Percie then had said,To such a person, and in such a place,At such a time, with all the rest retold,May reasonably dye, and neuer rise
To do him wrong, or any way impeachWhat then he said, so he vnsay it nowKing. Why yet doth deny his Prisoners,But with Prouiso and Exception,
That we at our owne charge, shall ransome straightHis Brother-in-Law, the foolish Mortimer,Who (in my soule) hath wilfully betraidThe liues of those, that he did leade to Fight,
Against the great Magitian, damn'd Glendower:Whose daughter (as we heare) the Earle of MarchHath lately married. Shall our Coffers then,Be emptied, to redeeme a Traitor home?
Shall we buy Treason? and indent with Feares,When they haue lost and forfeyted themselues.No: on the barren Mountaine let him sterue:For I shall neuer hold that man my Friend,

But by the chance of Warre: to proue that true,Needs no more but one tongue. For all those Wounds,Those mouthed Wounds, which valiantly he tooke,When on the gentle Seuernes siedgie banke,
In single Opposition hand to hand,He did confound the best part of an houreIn changing hardiment with great Glendower:Three times they breath'd, and three times did they drink
Vpon agreement, of swift Seuernes flood;Who then affrighted with their bloody lookes,Ran fearefully among the trembling Reeds,And hid his crispe-head in the hollow banke,
Blood-stained with these Valiant Combatants.Neuer did base and rotten PolicyColour her working with such deadly wounds;Nor neuer could the Noble Mortimer
Receiue so many, and all willingly:Then let him not be sland'red with ReuoltKing. Thou do'st bely him Percy, thou dost bely him;He neuer did encounter with Glendower:

But shall it be, that you that set the CrowneVpon the head of this forgetfull man,And for his sake, wore the detested blotOf murtherous subornation? Shall it be,
