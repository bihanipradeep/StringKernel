It's not enough to just thank our essential workers ‚Äî we need to pay them. As president, I‚Äôll: - Raise the minimum wage to $15 - End the tipped minimum wage - End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities - Ensure everyone has strong benefits
Every day Donald Trump proves how morally unfit he is to lead our nation. In 60 days, we have to vote him out.It's not enough to just thank our essential workers ‚Äî we need to pay them.

For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions. It will end on my watch. I'll sign the PRO Act ‚Äî making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain ‚Äî and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.
Today, we honor the generations of union workers who fought for the rights, power, wages, and benefits that built and sustained the great American middle class. #LaborDay
Time and again, the president has refused to provide Puerto Rico with much-needed resources. He‚Äôs repeatedly insulted Puerto Ricans and this latest action is another example of his disrespect for the island. This ends when I‚Äôm elected president.
We all want our schools to reopen ‚Äî but we need to do it in a way that puts the health and safety of our students and educators first. Here's how @KamalaHarris and I will reopen our schools safely and effectively:
The economy wasn‚Äôt working for folks long before this virus hit. That‚Äôs why @KamalaHarris and I won‚Äôt just build back to the way things were ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to build back better. We‚Äôre going to make sure everyone has a fair shot to get ahead.
As president, I will: - Call for nationwide mask mandates - Implement widespread testing - Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines I‚Äôm ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track.
Nicaraguan asylum seekers fleeing oppression deserve to have their cases heard. Instead, they‚Äôre being deported back into the tyrannical grip of Daniel Ortega without a chance to pursue their claims. President Trump‚Äôs cruelty truly knows no bounds.
Mr. President, enough with the weekend golf trips and erratic tweets. It's time for you to get to work and control the spread of this virus.
To be clear: I am not currently president. But if you chip in now, we can change that in November: joe.link/35LrCCJ twitter.com/Acyn/status/13‚Ä¶
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for all of us. She was a giant of the Court and unflinching in her pursuit of equal justice under the law. Because of her life‚Äôs work, we are closer to that more perfect union we‚Äôve always strived to be. pic.twitter.com/o30ZCuj10G
The Supreme Court is on the ballot. And the outcome will impact everything from health care to civil rights ‚Äî affecting generations to come.
Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico ‚Äî but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria. It's unacceptable.
We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing.
The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share ‚Äî and we'll invest that money in working families.
President Trump promised the opioid crisis would end "quickly" if he won, but the fact is drug overdose deaths are up nearly 10% across the country. It's heartbreaking.
Folks, I just wrapped up my first CNN Town Hall of the general election. We‚Äôre in the home stretch of this campaign and your support matters more than ever.
Hispanic Heritage Month is a reminder of the strength we draw as a nation from our immigrant roots. No matter where your family came from, we're here because we all share the same ideals. That's the story of America ‚Äî and it is well worth celebrating. joebiden.com/2020/09/15/sta‚Ä¶
Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise.
As schools begin another year of instruction, policymakers should prioritize giving parents the flexibility to choose the educational option that is right for them.
Americans lost trillions of dollars of income and tens of millions of person-years of work. The job losses were also concentrated among disadvantaged groups, increasing inequality along the dimensions of both education and race. jec.senate.gov/public/index.c‚Ä¶
Output gaps are the difference between actual output (what the economy produces) and potential output (the maximum amount the economy could produce sustainably over the long term with financial stability.)
The most recent example of a large output gap comes from the 2008-2009 recession, when 8.7 million nonfarm jobs were shed. The output gap then persisted for about a decade; the jobs were not immediately regained, but rather, slowly added back over a period of many years.
Output gaps essentially involve the cyclical unemployment: the work and income lost to the business cycle. To the extent that output gaps are measurable, one could measure them in person-years of work lost, or cumulative GDP lost over time.

Many Americans are willing to provide foster care, adopt foster children, or both. Roughly 1/4 of Americans say they have considered becoming a foster parent, and among Americans who have never adopted, roughly 1/4 say they have considered it.
Some states do better than others at moving children in foster care to permanent homes. Find out how your state stacks up ‚Üì
2007-2018 Federal Reserve policy erred too far towards curbing the growth of nominal spending‚Äîa stance known colloquially as ‚Äútoo tight‚Äù monetary policy. The result was a long, persistent shortfall in GDP relative to what the economy could have produced with more ample spending.
Only 8% of people who inquire about becoming foster parents eventually become licensed. The majority of those who do become licensed foster parents cease their service relatively quickly. 1/2
