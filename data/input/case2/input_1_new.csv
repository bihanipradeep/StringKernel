So is it not with me as with that Muse Stirr'd by a paintedbeauty to his verse Who heaven itself for ornament doth use And every fair with hisfair doth rehearse Making a couplement of proud compareWith sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems With April's first-born flowers,and all things rare That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems O'
let me, true in love, but truly writeAnd then believe me, my love is as fair As any mother's child,though not so bright As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's airLet them say more than like of hearsay well I will not praise that purpose not
to sell Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove meFor shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,Who for thyself art so unprovident.Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,But that thou none lovest is most evident;For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate That 'gainst
thyself thou stick'st not to conspire. Seeking that beauteous roof to\ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire.O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind! Shall hate be fairerlodged than gentle love? Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind, Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
Make thee another self, for love of me, That beauty still may live in thine or thee.Who will believe my verse in time to come,If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.If I could write the beauty of your eyesAnd in fresh numbers number all your graces,The age to come would say 'This poet lies:
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'So should my papers yellow'd with their ageBe scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
And stretched metre of an antique song:But were some child of yours alive that time,You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,But as the riper should by time decease,His tender heir might bear his memory:But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,Making a famine where abundance lies,Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
And only herald to the gaudy spring,Within thine own bud buriest thy content,And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mineShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'Proving his beauty by succession thine!
This were to be new made when thou art old,And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.Now is the time that face should form another;Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.For where is she so fair whose unear'd wombDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
Of his self-love to stop posterity?Thou art thy mother's glass and she in theeCalls back the lovely April of her prime;So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.But if thou live, remember'd not to be,Die single and thine image dies with thee.Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,And being frank she lends to those are free:Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuseThe bounteous largess given thee to give?
Profitless usurer, why dost thou useSo great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?For having traffic with thy self alone,Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,What acceptable audit canst thou leave?Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
Those hours, that with gentle work did frameThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,Will play the tyrants to the very sameAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel;
For never-resting time leads summer onTo hideous winter, and confounds him there;Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
Then were not summer's distillation left,A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some placeWith beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.That use is not forbidden usury,Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
That's for thy self to breed another thee,Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,Leaving thee living in posterity?Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fairTo be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
Lo! in the orient when the gracious lightLifts up his burning head, each under eyeDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,Resembling strong youth in his middle age,Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted areFrom his low tract, and look another way:
So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.\Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,By unions married, do offend thine ear,
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confoundsIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
Resembling sire and child and happy mother,Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,That thou consum'st thy self in single life?Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
The world will be thy widow and still weepThat thou no form of thee hast left behind,When every private widow well may keepBy children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spendShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,And kept unused the user so destroys it.
No love toward others in that bosom sitsThat on himself such murd'rous shame commits.For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,Who for thy self art so unprovident.
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,But that thou none lov'st is most evident:For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinateWhich to repair should be thy chief desire.O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:Make thee another self for love of me,That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,In one of thine, from that which thou departest;And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;Without this folly, age, and cold decay:If all were minded so, the times should ceaseAnd threescore year would make the world away.
Let those whom nature hath not made for store,Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.When I do count the clock that tells the time,And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
When I behold the violet past prime,And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,Then of thy beauty do I question make,That thou among the wastes of time must go,
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsakeAnd die as fast as they see others grow;And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defenceSave breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.
you were your self; but, love you areNo longer yours, than you your self here live:Against this coming end you should prepare,And your sweet semblance to some other give:
So should that beauty which you hold in leaseFind no determination; then you wereYourself again, after yourself's decease,When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,Which husbandry in honour might uphold,Against the stormy gusts of winter's dayAnd barren rage of death's eternal cold?
O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;And yet methinks I have astronomy,But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find:But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,And constant stars in them I read such artAs 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';Or else of thee this I prognosticate:'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'When I consider every thing that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment,That this huge stage presenteth nought but showsWhereon the stars in secret influence comment;When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,And wear their brave state out of memory;Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,Where wasteful Time debateth with decayTo change your day of youth to sullied night,And all in war with Time for love of you,
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.But wherefore do not you a mightier wayMake war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?And fortify your self in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?Now stand you on the top of happy hours,And many maiden gardens, yet unset,With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:So should the lines of life that life repair,Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
Can make you live your self in eyes of men.To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.When forty winters shall beseige thy browAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty's fieldThy youth's proud livery, so gazed on nowWill be a tatter'd weed, of small worth heldThen being ask'd where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty daysTo say, within thine own deep-sunken eyesWere an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mineShall sum my count and make my old excuse,Proving his beauty by succession thine!This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her stillWhile comments of your praise, richly compil'd[Rehearse thy] character with golden quill
And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.I think good thoughts while others write good wordsAnd, like unletter'd clerk, still cry 'AmenTo every hymn that able spirit affords
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.Hearing you praised, I say "'Tis so, 'tis true,"And to the most of praise add something moreBut that is in my thought, whose love to you
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.Then others for the breath of words respectMe for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing
And like enough thou know'st thy estimateThe charter of thy worth gives thee releasingMy bonds in thee are all determinate.For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
And for that riches where is my deserving?The cause of this fair gift in me is wantingAnd so my patent back again is swerving.Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistakingSo thy great gift, upon misprision growingComes home again, on better judgment making.Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.That you were once unkind, befriends me nowAnd for that sorrow, which I then did feelNeeds must I under my transgression bow
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.For if you were by my unkindness shakenAs I by yours, y' have pass'd a hell of timeAnd I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.O, that our night of woe might have remember'dMy deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hitsAnd soon to you, as you to me, then tendered
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits!But that your trespass now becomes a feeMine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?To make me give the lie to my true sightAnd swear that brightness doth not grace the day?Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
That in the very refuse of thy deedsThere is such strength and warrantise of skillThat, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?O, though I love what others do abhorWith others thou shouldst not abhor my stateIf thy unworthiness rais'd love in me
More worthy I to be beloved of thee.The little Love-god lying once asleepLaid by his side his heart-inflaming brandWhilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden handThe fairest votary took up that fireWhich many legions of true hearts had warm'dAnd so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.This brand she quenched in a cool well byWhich from Love's fire took heat perpetualGrowing a bath and healthful remedy
