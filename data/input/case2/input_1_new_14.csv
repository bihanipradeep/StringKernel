Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well;We leave you now with better company.SALERIO. I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,If worthier friends had not prevented me.
ANTONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard.I take it your own business calls on you,And you embrace th' occasion to depart.SALERIO. Good morrow, my good lords.
BASSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.You grow exceeding strange; must it be so?SALERIO. We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO
LORENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,We two will leave you; but at dinner-time,I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.BASSANIO. I will not fail you.
GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio;You have too much respect upon the world;They lose it that do buy it with much care.Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd.
ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-A stage, where every man must play a part,And mine a sad one.GRATIANO. Let me play the fool.
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;And let my liver rather heat with wineThan my heart cool with mortifying groans.Why should a man whose blood is warm within
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster,Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundiceBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio-I love thee, and 'tis my love that speaks-
There are a sort of men whose visagesDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,And do a wilful stillness entertain,With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.'O my Antonio, I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wiseFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,If they should speak, would almost damn those earsWhich, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
I'll tell thee more of this another time.But fish not with this melancholy baitFor this fool gudgeon, this opinion.Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile;
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.LORENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.I must be one of these same dumb wise men,For Gratiano never lets me speak.
GRATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe,Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.ANTONIO. Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.GRATIANO. Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
In a neat's tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZOANTONIO. Is that anything now?BASSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
thanany man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheathidin, two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find
them, and when you have them they are not worth the search.ANTONIO. Well; tell me now what lady is the sameTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,That you to-day promis'd to tell me of?
BASSANIO. 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,How much I have disabled mine estateBy something showing a more swelling portThan my faint means would grant continuance;
Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'dFrom such a noble rate; but my chief careIs to come fairly off from the great debtsWherein my time, something too prodigal,
Hath left me gag'd. To you, Antonio,I owe the most, in money and in love;And from your love I have a warrantyTo unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.ANTONIO. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;And if it stand, as you yourself still do,Within the eye of honour, be assur'd
My purse, my person, my extremest means,Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.BASSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The self-same way, with more advised watch,To find the other forth; and by adventuring bothI oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth,That which I owe is lost; but if you pleaseTo shoot another arrow that self wayWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both,Or bring your latter hazard back againAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;And out of doubt you do me now more wrongIn making question of my uttermostThan if you had made waste of all I have.
Then do but say to me what I should doThat in your knowledge may by me be done,And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak.BASSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left,
And she is fair and, fairer than that word,Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyesI did receive fair speechless messages.Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu'd
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth;For the four winds blow in from every coastRenowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strond,And many Jasons come in quest of her.O my Antonio, had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,I have a mind presages me such thriftThat I should questionless be fortunate.ANTONIO. Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodityTo raise a present sum; therefore go forth,Try what my credit can in Venice do;That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.Go presently inquire, and so will I,Where money is; and I no question makeTo have it of my trust or for my sake
Enter PORTIA with her waiting-woman, NERISSAPORTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of thisgreat world.NERISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
thesame abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aughtIsee, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that
starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, tobeseated in the mean: superfluity come sooner by white hairs,but
competency lives longer.PORTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.NERISSA. They would be better, if well followed.PORTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,
chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes'palaces. It is a good divine that follows his owninstructions; Ican easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be
oneof the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain maydeviselaws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold
decree;such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o'er the meshes ofgoodcounsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion
tochoose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose'! I may neitherchoose who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the willof a
living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father. Is itnothard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their
deathhave good inspirations; therefore the lott'ry that he hathdevised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead-whereof
who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never bechosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. Butwhat warmth is there in your affection towards any of theseprincely suitors that are already come?
PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, Iwilldescribe them; and according to my description, level at myaffection.
NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.PORTIA. Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talkofhis horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own
goodparts that he can shoe him himself; I am much afear'd my ladyhismother play'd false with a smith.
NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine.PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An youwillnot have me, choose.' He hears merry tales and smiles not. I
fearhe will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old,being sofull of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
marriedto a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either ofthese. God defend me from these two!NERISSA. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
PORTIA. God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. Intruth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he- why, hehath ahorse better than the Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of
frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man.If athrostle sing he falls straight a-cap'ring; he will fencewith
his own shadow; if I should marry him, I should marry twentyhusbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him; for ifhelove me to madness, I shall never requite him.
NERISSA. What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron ofEngland?PORTIA. You know I say nothing to him, for he understands notme,
nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, andyouwill come into the court and swear that I have a poorpennyworth
in the English. He is a proper man's picture; but alas, whocanconverse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think hebought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his
bonnetin Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.NERISSA. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?PORTIA. That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
borroweda box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would payhimagain when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his
surety,and seal'd under for another.NERISSA. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony'snephew?
PORTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and mostvilely in the afternoon when he is drunk. When he is best, heisa little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little
better than a beast. An the worst fall that ever fell, I hopeIshall make shift to go without him.NERISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
casket,you should refuse to perform your father's will, if youshouldrefuse to accept him.
PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set adeepglass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for if thedevil be
within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it.Iwill do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
lords;they have acquainted me with their determinations, which isindeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with nomore
suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than yourfather'simposition, depending on the caskets.PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste
asDiana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father'swill. Iam glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is
notone among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray Godgrant them a fair departure.NERISSA. Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither incompany ofthe Marquis of Montferrat?PORTIA. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he
call'd.NERISSA. True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolisheyeslook'd upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
