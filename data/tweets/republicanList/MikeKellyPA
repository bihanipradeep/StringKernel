Who do we trust when it comes to our health? Medical professionals or @JoyVBehar? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and I did what all Americans should do before taking Hydroxychloroquine - we sought the counsel of our trusted doctors. That's what "anybody with a brain" would do. pic.twitter.com/agec1oIWXu
‚ÄúI just thought for me to give up a couple hours of my life to go and donate....what an easy way to maybe be part of a cure that the world is searching for right now.‚Äù

I spoke w/ @rollcall about my plasma donation to help those fighting #COVID19.

So far, the response to #COVID19 has been largely bipartisan, but now Speaker Pelosi has decided that political posturing is more important than getting Americans through the economic devastation this pandemic has caused. I voted 'NO' on her bill tonight.

Doctors and nurses need our support as they risk their own health to treat #COVID19 patients. I introduced the Essential Workforce Parity Act to extend paid medical leave to America's health care heroes if they get sick while caring for others. kelly.house.gov/press-release/‚Ä¶
Happy birthday to @USCG, which turns 230 years old today.

Most on @SocialSecurity won‚Äôt need to do anything to receive stimulus payments, but those w/ dependent children under 17 who didn't file taxes in 2018/2019 must use the IRS non-filer tool by tomorrow (üö®) to receive the $500 payment for each child.

I have been declared free of #COVID19 by doctors after testing negative for the virus & positive for antibodies last week. Thank you to everyone who prayed & sent well wishes for my recovery!

As someone who has donated plasma, it's an easy way to make a big difference for someone in need. If you've recovered from COVID-19, consult your doctor about where you can donate and help save lives! pic.twitter.com/vZywDH6Ai4
Today I received word that I tested positive for COVID-19. My symptoms are mild, and I will continue serving Pennsylvania's 16th District from home until I fully recover.

Medical providers need financial help as they fight COVID-19. Medicare advance payments are an option, but their 10.25% interest rate is too high. My colleagues and I asked @CMSGov to lower these rates to expand access to this program. ‚¨áÔ∏è

Great news! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has once again demonstrated his commitment to western Pennsylvania with a @USDOT grant for Erie International Airport. twitter.com/realDonaldTrum‚Ä¶
The CARES Act is headed to @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, and help is on the way to American workers, businesses, and health care heroes.

The response to #COVID19 has been largely bipartisan until now, but the Democrats' new $3 trillion bill is a progressive wish list that puts politics over people. They should work w/ Republicans & @POTUS, not abuse the crisis to ram through their radical change America agenda.
This is the @HouseGOP #CommitmenttoAmerica:

To *Restore* our way of life.
To *Rebuild* the greatest economy in history.
To *Renew* the American dream.

Thank you @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for taking decisive executive action to help families pay their bills and get through this pandemic. Even as Democrats continue to play political games, this administration and Congressional Republicans will go to bat for working Americans.
Happy birthday to @USCG, which turns 230 years old today.

Our nation was made better because of John Lewis' fearless stand for equality with Dr. Martin Luther King. Mr. Lewis' time on Earth was well spent and touched all of us. I am honored to have served with him and to have called this great man a friend.
When we support small businesses like local music venues, we‚Äôre supporting our communities. The #RESTART Act will build on the success of #PPP by helping companies survive and workers thrive during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Great news today!  The U.S. economy added 4.8 million jobs in June, and the unemployment rate fell from 13.3 percent to 11.1 percent.  This report is an incredible testimony to the country's resilience and our steady recovery!
Thank you to all our great soldiers that have defended freedom here at home and abroad. We appreciate you. twitter.com/USArmy/status/‚Ä¶
It is one thing to call for police accountability, which is needed, but de-funding or abolishing police is nonsense. Most cops are great people who do a difficult job well. I stand with Americans who demand equal justice AND good officers who selflessly serve our communities.
Opportunity zones are helping revitalize western PA, & they will help us through the economic devastation caused by coronavirus. Last month, @RepRonKind & I urged @IRSNews to extend deadlines for OZ investment & I am thankful that @POTUS delivered!

Some encouraging news for U.S. workers. The coronavirus wreaked havoc on the economy, but we are already bouncing back.

Before this pandemic Americans had built the best economy in half a century, and we will do it again!

The death of #GeorgeFloyd is a tragedy. Our nation is right to mourn. I ask all western PA to unite in love of neighbor & to treat all people as we would like to be treated.

But riots are self-defeating & create more problems than they solve. Riot prevention is justice for all.
Sam Johnson was an American hero and among our greatest patriots. He served our country and the people of Texas selflessly - in the military and in Congress - and made a lasting impact on all of us. It was an honor to serve alongside him. He will be missed. pic.twitter.com/MiPD5kUeTz
