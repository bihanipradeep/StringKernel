@GovParsonMO is absolutely right to reopen Missouri. 

I look forward to our great state reopening for business, getting our economy going again, and hardworking Missourians having the ability to once again support their families.

COVID-19 has created a real-life case study of CECL’s procyclicality & has shown it wreaks havoc in a downturn. This harmful accounting standard is bad for institutions, investors, & everyday Americans.
 
It’s time we eliminate #CECL once and for all.

Whether it's Fulton’s annual Independence Day Parade, Eldon’s Firecracker 5k Race, the fireworks displays happening all over MO, or next to your grill, the 3rd District is a great place to celebrate our nation’s independence.

Since its passage, #PPP has helped tens of millions of Americans supporting over 80% of small biz employees & more than 51 million jobs nationwide.

Here in MO, over $9.1 billion has been loaned to businesses keeping doors open & employees on payroll.

Don’t forget to join me TONIGHT for a tele-town hall on the coronavirus. 

Please sign up by noon today to join our call list: luetkemeyer.house.gov/forms/form/?ID…

ICYMI: Yesterday I joined @tperkins on “Washington Watch” to discuss the issue of hospitals reporting unrelated fatalities as COVID-19 deaths to receive more funding.  

Highlights and full interview here: luetkemeyer.house.gov/news/documents…
Today in @SelectGOP, I discussed funding for education, testing for schools and retirement homes and getting our economy back on track.
luetkemeyer.house.gov/news/documents…
.@CDCgov Director and @HHSGov Assist. Secretary for Health have now both confirmed in @SelectGOP that hospitals in some states have been reporting unrelated fatalities as COVID-19 deaths to receive more funding. 

This irresponsible and unethical practice cannot continue. pic.twitter.com/zqzPxcFKH2
With repeated calls from Democrats to “defund the police” & violent riots taking place, our 2nd Amendment rights are more meaningful than ever. 

The ability to protect your property & family is a fundamentally American right that I firmly believe in.

Getting Missouri students back to school this fall is incredibly important to their social, physical and academic well-being. 

I'm hopeful that we can work together to get our state’s schools reopened in a responsible and safe way.

.@COVIDOversight Dems are feigning concern over the loan process they themselves helped design in the CARES Act. 

Their demand for the personal & financial info of millions of Americans is an attempt to shame small biz owners & attack the Administration. luetkemeyer.house.gov/news/documents…
.@realDonaldTrump took decisive action to protect our country by restricting travel from China to slow the spread of COVID-19. Today, House Dems voted to undermine POTUS' ability to secure our borders and keep us safe. 

These political games are putting American lives in danger.
SCOTUS just confirmed what many of us have said for years: the unchecked power of @CFPB director is unconstitutional. 

Progress, but my bill establishes a bipartisan commission to ensure consumer protection rules/regs won't change with the political tide.

We can protect those who are at-risk without having our entire state shut down. Missourians have the right to make their own decisions, and @GovParsonMO is absolutely right to reopen our state. luetkemeyer.house.gov/news/documents…
As the shutdown's lingered across the country, financial institutions will need to give flexibility & forbearance to customers beyond the CARES Act.
 
My bill provides a long-term fix to get biz through this precarious time & our economy back on its feet. luetkemeyer.house.gov/news/documents…
Today in @SelectGOP, my fellow Missourian @MissouriSOS Jay Ashcroft confirmed our election integrity is being well-maintained, voter participation in our state is up, and Missourians are voting safely and in person.

Big thank you to Taiwan's President Tsai for moving to lift restrictions on imports of U.S. pork and beef which will lead to even stronger bilateral trade opportunities. Good news for our livestock producers!
While learning from home was an acceptable alternative as we began understanding the virus & preparing our response, MO’s numbers have improved, cases & fatalities have decreased over the last few months and it is time to finally return to school. luetkemeyer.house.gov/news/documents…
Don't forget! @IRSnews has reopened the registration period until September 30th for families who weren't able to register in time to receive $500 per child with their Economic Impact Payments. Find more info & how to register here: irs.gov/newsroom/irs-t…
