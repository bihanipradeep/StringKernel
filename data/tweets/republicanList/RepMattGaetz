"We killed hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East.

I always say it's the bloodiest sand anywhere in the world, and it didn't have to be that way.

"Now really what we're looking to do is get the power back on. You've probably got about 200,000 people in Northwest Florida with no power, most of it's in Escambia, Santa Rosa county. We have trucks coming in, 7,000 linemen are working 24/7." -@GovRonDeSantis pic.twitter.com/5QeWUTaGPU
Our emergency management teams at the local, state, and federal levels are working together to help Northwest Florida recover.

While some nursing homes in NW Florida have lost power, all currently have operating generators and none are experiencing flooding at this time.

If your loved one is in a #NWFL nursing home, they are being cared for even if you are unable to reach them.

Stay home and stay safe.
The passengers of United 93 did the most American of things: they took a vote.

They pledged allegiance to one another just as we pledge allegiance when we stand for the flag or the anthem.

We do these things together because we know how hard they were won by those who lost all.
