ICYMI: My latest at @dcexaminer, on how Dems' proposed stimulus is "eerily similar" to the one passed in 2009, w/ disastrous results. @realDonaldTrump's economy was booming before #COVID19. We need Americans at work to recover that, not expanded welfare.

Multiple #COVID19 vaccine candidates are nearing or are already conducting final-stage trials. This is a huge step in defeating the virus, and the Trump Administration should be commended for its work to develop a vaccine on a historically fast timeline. #OperationWarpSpeed pic.twitter.com/ZZ8Pvtq8KU
I'm thrilled #SCOTUS ruled yesterday, in a 7-2 decision, in favor of the #LittleSistersofthePoor, holding that the Sisters are exempt from the contraceptive mandate on religious grounds. This case is a huge win for religious liberty for all!

It is sad that @ClimateCrisis Democrats once again hid from real debate at this week‚Äôs hearing by attacking @ShellenbergerMD‚Äôs character and then refusing him the right to defend himself. Read his response that the Democrats tried to silence here: quillette.com/2020/07/29/why‚Ä¶
The economic fallout from #COVID19 has been severe, and sadly, many have used the crisis for their own ends. Fraudulent unemployment claims have already become a problem, so today, I introduced a bill to try to reduce fraud and waste. Read more here:

I chatted with @NPRinskeep of @NPR yesterday morning in advance of the Oversight & Reform hearing about the @USPS. What I discussed then remained true during the hearing. It was about political posturing, not "saving" the USPS. Listen here:

Today in a @USPS hearing, I noted how selective Dems' outrage is. During the Obama Admin, dozens of mail-facilities closed & there was a 48% increase in slowed mail delivery, yet @OversightDems didn't bother to discuss it then. Full Q&A & statement:

I'm sure mail in Portland, Seattle, Chicago, NYC, & Minneapolis has been delayed lately. I'd submit that time would've been better spent today ensuring law enforcement in major cities is funded so they can protect USPS facilities & people who deliver mail. youtube.com/watch?v=oo5TAy‚Ä¶
