Good to see my proposal promoted alongside @RepGallagher’s to defend #Taiwan from Chinese military aggression. The era of strategic ambiguity’s usefulness has passed. A policy of strategic clarity towards Taiwan is needed to prevent a full-scale invasion. bit.ly/3iRdElY
This bill created the block grant program & was signed into law by @realdonaldtrump. Timber producers who were affected by Hurricane Michael may now apply for the program.  bit.ly/2Yv8mVs
Honored to join newly appointed #Taiwan Amb. Hsiao earlier this week in presenting the #AmericanLegion with 250,000 masks for #Veterans. pic.twitter.com/UEXMfyWcvz
Grateful to the people of #Taiwan for their generous gift of 10K medical masks to help keep #Putnam Co. safe. The global health partnership between the U.S. & #Taiwan is strong. #PPE #COVID__19 pic.twitter.com/X5qQEEnvNc
Grateful to the @FAPA_HQ for raising funds to donate over 2K face shields to FL’s Jackson Memorial Hospital. The U.S.-#Taiwan global health partnership is strong, & I look forward to deepening our cooperation on efforts like these. pic.twitter.com/vOpRk7NhaL
I couldn’t have said it better myself. Thank you @iingwen for your masterful leadership of #Taiwan and your strong support for #democracy and #HumanRights around the world. twitter.com/iingwen/status…
#China admits in a white paper that from 2014-19 it“reeducated” 1.3M #Uyghurs in camps—meaning that the number of Uyghurs that have been imprisoned in these concentration camps could be as high as 8M. If this is what the #CCP will admit to publicly, what is being hidden from view
Congrats to @sugawitter for assuming the Office of the PM of #Japan this week - replacing @AbeShinzo. My colleagues & I look forward to working with you on common ground issues between our two countries & paving the way towards a more peaceful & stable #IndoPacific region.
Ready, Relevant, Responsive - Happy 230th Birthday @USCG! #SemperParatus twitter.com/USCG/status/12…
Thank you for standing strong for our farmers, Mr. President! twitter.com/realDonaldTrum…
Honored to witness history & attend today's signing ceremony at the @WhiteHouse. The agreement btw #Israel, #UAE, & #Bahrain will transform the #MiddleEast. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for this great accomplishment.
When I authored the #BUILDAct, this is exactly the kind of private-public engagement I imagined for energizing international development. Great work by #DFC & Eleanor Crook Foundation in partnering to support global nutrition efforts. prn.to/2CcwwfC
Restore.Rebuild.Renew! 

I applaud @GOPLeader McCarthy for his leadership and for introducing @HouseGOP's #CommitmentToAmerica that will "restore our way of life; rebuild the greatest economy; and renew the American dream."

#PuertoRico is a leader in the #Pharmaceutical industry & has the potential to expand production to bring the drug supply chain back to the US. This will create US jobs, strengthen our domestic supply chains, & end our reliance on #China for our nation’s needs. #AnywhereButChina
Communist #China has always viewed the US as an oppressor to overthrow to become the next hegemon, instead of a benevolent partner on the world stage.
Today, I introduced a bipartisan bill to name the new Clay County VA Clinic, in Middleburg, FL, the A.K. Baker VA, Clinic.  I want to thank @SenRubioPress & the entire FL House Delegation for coming together in support of this legislation & our #Veterans.  bit.ly/2F1Haat
#USTR must take action immediately to provide relief for #Florida farmers who have suffered the consequences of unfair trade for far too long. twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis…
The words & actions of SE Asian nations speak loudly, especially on issues in their own backyard. As a productive partner & chair of #ASEAN, the US looks forward to continuing to work w/Vietnam in ensuring peace & stability in #SouthChinaSea & the region. bit.ly/2Fg8AJG
Tonight, the nation mourns the loss of a dedicated public servant & trailblazer who inspired many. 

Justice #RuthBaderGinsberg led an extraordinary life. My thoughts & prayers are with her & her family during this difficult time. May she rest in peace. #SCOTUS twitter.com/WSJ/status/130…
These “reeducation camps” & “vocational centers” are concentration & forced labor camps where innocent ethnic minorities are brainwashed of their culture & language, tortured & raped by state officials, & forced to abandon their dignity under a modern-day #Orwellian regime.
Our political leaders must do whatever it takes to prevent #China from destroying the democracy of #Taiwan.

The dangerous policy of strategic ambiguity only tempts China.

Let’s put an end to this possibility by passing the #TaiwanInvasionPreventionAct thehill.com/opinion/intern…

All those cameras & not one second of footage highlighting the millions being beaten, brainwashed & oppressed by the #CCP. Still “bringing honor to us all?”
First, they charge $30 for the movie, now @Disney is revealed to have worked with & thanked the propaganda machine in #Xinjiang - who is responsible for one of the largest ethnic cleansings since WWII in helping film Mulan. nyti.ms/3bDZ12O
This is why I introduced the Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act last month to provide clarity in our security relationship w/Taiwan & signal clearly to the #PRC that a Chinese attack on #Taiwan would provoke an overwhelming US military response. US must act now before it’s too late.
.@RichardHaass I couldn’t agree more. The US must draw a red line over Chinese military aggression. The future of #Taiwan must be decided by peaceful means, which the US must be prepared to defend with clear deterrents & adequate hard power capabilities. twitter.com/RichardHaass/s…
@iingwen's leadership in lifting these restrictions clears a hurdle & opens the door to the real possibility of a bilateral U.S./Taiwan FTA, something I have been advocating for years. Today’s decision strengthens our alliance. Thank you, President Tsai & the people of Taiwan.
Today is a great day for American farmers/ranchers, & U.S./Taiwan relations. After my many talks with @iingwen, about receiving U.S. pork exports to #Taiwan, she finally delivered.  I applaud her decision to lift restrictions on U.S. pork/beef imports. yhoo.it/3loun2d
The #SouthChinaSea is a shared maritime neighborhood that includes many countries with their own sovereign marine territory & the right to free navigation. A free & peaceful #IndoPacific requires open seaways. #China #ASEAN
The #CCP & #PLAN continue to claim sovereignty over features in the #SouthChinaSea that were underwater or no more than sandbars before being turned into remote offensive/defensive operations bases.
My bill, The Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act, will formally commit the US to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese PLA attack. reut.rs/31uYRrp
Strategic ambiguity is a detriment to US/Taiwanese interests & only strengthens #Beijing. The US must embrace strategic clarity in our defense relationship with #Taiwan.
We must be prepared to defend the international order that has encouraged global prosperity and prevented large scale conflict over the past 75+ years from malign actors like the #PLA.
Communist #China has always viewed the US as an oppressor to overthrow to become the next hegemon, instead of a benevolent partner on the world stage.
