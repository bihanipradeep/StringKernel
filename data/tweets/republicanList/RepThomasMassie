The number of hunting licenses sold annually in the United States is greater than the number of troops in the world‚Äôs 10 largest militaries combined.

Politicians considering gun confiscation (aka mandatory buybacks) should chew on that.

Thanks Evan.  Following now.
Somber reminder of US Military casualties in the war in Afghanistan:

Bush: 630
Obama: 1758
Trump: 63

One more US casualty in this war is one too many. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for winding this war down. Let‚Äôs end it.

End the #endlesswars

This author‚Äôs own opinion is that transmission of highly infectious viruses ... could be impacted if all members of society wore protective goggles and N-95 respirators all of the time. The feasibility of such an approach is questionable.
Here we are 6 months after I forced half of Congress to show up to vote on $2 trillion bill, and the media is still spinning it as if it was too dangerous to come to DC that day. Last month, Pelosi called Congress into session to vote on a messaging bill. No word on her actions? pic.twitter.com/I5W7pmDQKc
The data show that, so far, only one state has had substantially more deaths per million (associated with COVID) than NY, and that‚Äôs NJ. In fact Sweden and Italy have fared substantially better than the state of NY. pic.twitter.com/fKNDojcD8V

lol. I knew there‚Äôd be one. It‚Äôs been wet here.  Needed cut a month ago.
They said there was no evidence of a problem.
First picture is actual data.  Second picture is a research paper from before COVID, with one of the curves highlighted yellow and red by me.

takeaway: a state hasn‚Äôt escaped the virus just because it witnessed data like the yellow curve. The red portion of that curve is coming. pic.twitter.com/Dqmblt9EMC
It‚Äôs my thinking time, but I do listen for belts slipping, blades hitting rocks, motor bogging down, etc.  Lol.
To be fair, yesterday was a holiday.
