@realDonaldTrump won tonight and he wasn’t even competing - congratulations @TheDemocrats !
Keeping Wisconsin Red! @realDonaldTrump @SeanDuffyWI @MikeforWI @RepGrothman @RonJohnsonWI twitter.com/BryanSteil/sta…
From here on out, most Presidents will now get impeached when the opposite party holds the House.  This is a new political game that will play out for decades to come.
Love these Libs melting down because @seanspicer keeps surviving - maybe it’s because people are actually voting for him! He’s not even close to the bottom two.  #DWTS @realDonaldTrump
Totally false.  She forgot to show up - now making up false and hurtful stories. twitter.com/Mediaite/statu…
Huge overreach. Democrats handing @realDonaldTrump a victory on this one. twitter.com/mkraju/status/…
This is more than a generous compromise offered by @realDonaldTrump. Even some R’s may protest.  Dems should stop playing politics - take the offer and run.

Winning. twitter.com/chrisgeidner/s…
An R/X rated spectacle that started poorly and ended up in the bottom of the canyon.  Another victory for @realDonaldTrump for not attending and proving his point once again.  The room was uncomfortable.  Trump lovers and even a large number of Trump haters were pretty miserable.
Absolutely incredible in every way.  That speech will be remembered and thought of as historically great.

POTUS crushed it tonight!
Wow.  Dems miscalculated big league here.
Been great to have time off - but excited to be joining @MichaelBestLaw as President and working out of DC & pumped to join @WashSpeakers !
Thanks to @POTUS, Foxconn, @ScottWalker, @PRyan and the entire Wisconsin & @WhiteHouse teams
