Discussing one of the most important topics today at ⁦@housesciencegop⁩ hearing - The role of technology in countering human trafficking. The Dems called this hearing but... *crickets*... where are they? Plenty of room!

⁦Ft. my good friend ⁦@RepRalphNorman⁩ pic.twitter.com/8kcHXr5jAo
A big thank you to the hard working teams at ⁦@LockheedMartin⁩ & ⁦@Nanoracks⁩ for having us. Both companies are working hard to ensure America maintains its competitive edge in space. More to come! pic.twitter.com/iXvHnTrfGd
Congratulations on your nomination, Greg! @GregWAutry @NASA
Prime Minister Netanyahu, we write to reaffirm U.S. support for Israel’s sovereignty. It is shameful that some members of the Democratic party are choosing to put politics above the safety & security of our ally.

As part of the Trump Admin’s Pledge to American Workers Initiative, findsomethingnew.org was launched w/ leaders in the private sector to showcase the many pathways to career success that don’t req. a traditional 2 or 4 yr. college degree. 

Thank you @realDonaldTrump!
Happy birthday to a great man—General Tom Stafford. It was an honor & a privilege to visit with you & hear stories of your remarkable life journey. Thank you for your continued leadership & dedication to exploration. You’re an American hero.  🎂

Great to welcome John Mulholland, @BoeingSpace VP and Program Manager for @Space_Station to Texas! Station is such an important national capability & I appreciate the effort put forth by @NASA & companies like @BoeingSpace to ensure the smooth continuation of ISS ops! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/Cn54C7fnaW
Elizabeth Warren asks: “what has the Covid virus done to our babies?” Why isn’t she asking what has abortion done to our babies? Especially black babies? Black lives do matter. Black babies lives matter also. Such hypocrisy! Thank GOD for a Pro-Life Donald Trump! @realDonaldTrump
I am saddened by the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg today.  While we may not have agreed on many issues, she served our great country honorably on the Supreme Court for 27 years. She leaves behind a legacy of achievements for justice and equality. 1/2
My thoughts and prayers are with her family and our nation as her loss is mourned. 2/2
Chris Hahn: former aid to Schumer is really ridiculous on Fox News tonight. He is so skeptical about our great president that he would demand a bacteria count on the milk of human kindness. He is a partisan hack! He should be ashamed! Thank God - Fox News is reporting the truth!
So the economy’s on the mend. Mark my words- This President will bring back the economy quicker than it has ever been brought back before. Under Obama:slowest recovery in 70 years. Trump will bring it back faster than he built it the 1st time. Trump 2020! MAGA! @realDonaldTrump
So Speaker Pelosi: who got her hair done while she lectured Americans to stay home & wear their masks-was “set up by hair salon” So the Speaker of the House with top level security clearance who was “set up” by a hairdresser... only thing she didn’t claim was Russian Collusion.
Thank YOU @LockheedMartin for contributing to such an important mission.

Good job Governor! Having been a precinct chair, a deputy voter registrar, an election clerk & an election judge in Brazoria County almost 16 years; I have experience in the election process. The State needs to set the laws that govern the process. O wait: they did! #noHidalgo! twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/…
Excited to listen. @torybruno builds rockets—great rockets. Most recently, @ulalaunch sent @NASAPersevere on its journey to the red planet. Looking forward to discussion about the Vulcan Centaur rocket & future missions. 🚀🇺🇸 twitter.com/ExploreMars/st…

@WattersWorld so Jessie says He calls the absentee (vote by mail) ballots sent out as little embryo’s or what I call “MBRO’s” aka “More Broke Radical Offerings” I hope Americans are paying attention to this “end run” by the Socialist- Left Leaning Anti-American, Pelosi groupies!
What Democrat said “Never waste a good crisis?” He left out “manufactured!” D’s: if you don’t agree they say you have all kinds of “phobias” They claim you don’t like seniors, youth, minorities, the environment, etc. They left out baseball, motherhood & apple pie. Shameful!
Yes she has. All because the American people elected President Trump to do what he said he would do & Pelosi & the rest of the “Big Govt” Liberals don’t think American voters have good sense... sad... now the D’s would rather see the economy stay down... sad...@realDonaldTrump twitter.com/GOPLeader/stat…

You are being lied to by @SpeakerPelosi & the socialist D’s. This is a fake emergency. What did @RahmEmanuel say? - Never let a good crisis (emergency) go to waste.

Democrats are shameless. Pushing anarchy, socialism, conspiracy & even a recession - all to try to defeat Trump. Americans are not stupid. Trump has & will always be about making America Great, safe & prosperous! @realDonaldTrump twitter.com/GOPLeader/stat…
