Southwest Alabama faces a serious threat from #HurricaneSally. I thank the @realDonaldTrump administration for offering the full support of the federal government by granting @GovernorKayIvey's request for an emergency declaration. Full statement here: byrne.house.gov/media-center/p‚Ä¶
Reminder: NEVER operate a gas generator inside your home. Keep these devices outdoors, as carbon monoxide poisoning is a very serious concern. More good generator safety tips from the Red Cross: redcross.org/get-help/how-t‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm on my way to Gulf Shores and Orange Beach to meet with @GovernorKayIvey and local officials. I‚Äôm committed to ensuring all our federal partners are providing the assistance needed to help our area recover from #HurricaneSally.
The President has already approved an Emergency Declaration and I anticipate further federal assistance. whitehouse.gov/briefings-stat‚Ä¶

Areas across Southwest Alabama will have curfews in place tonight, so it is very important for everyone to stay home and off the roads. Law enforcement will be out enforcing the curfew and patrolling neighbors. Looting WILL NOT be tolerated. fox10tv.com/news/list-of-l‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm going live now on the @JeffPoorShow to give the most up to date info on #HurricaneSally. This is a dangerous storm with reports of catostrophic danger, but the threat has not passed. Stay home and be safe!

I‚Äôve talked with numerous officials in Baldwin County this morning, and there are reports of ‚Äúcatostrophic‚Äù damage. Please continue to stay off the roads and allow first responders to do their job.
Baldwin County is the fastest growing county in Alabama, yet we are lagging in our Census response. Take time today to complete the 2020 Census. If you have already completed yours, remind your family, friends, and neighbors to do the same! fox10tv.com/news/baldwin_c‚Ä¶
Everyone should minimize their time on the roads as much as possible. Now is not the time to be out driving around. Those in low-lying areas should evacuate to higher ground.
I just had a call with Director Ken Graham from the National Hurricane Center (@NWSNHC) to discuss the latest on #HurricaneSally. The biggest concern remains the heavy rain and the potential for significant flooding. Do not take this storm lightly!
There are a number of volunteer organizations helping with debris removal. The biggest issue is those wanting to perform actually work on roofs or property.
