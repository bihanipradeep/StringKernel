2/4 Men and Women of past and present have shown their courage and integrity protecting our freedoms; some, giving the ultimate sacrifice. For that, we owe them our eternal gratitude.
4 of 4 It was my honor and privilege to present the Gold Valor Award to Cadet Technical Sergeant Matthew Harrison. #saugusstrong pic.twitter.com/MRzbAFlvwd
1/4 Today we wish the @usairforce a Happy Birthday. It has been 73 years since the establishment of an independent air Force, and over the last 73 years, our Air Force has made us proud. pic.twitter.com/kNbBfZfPzt
3/4 California's 25th District has a special connection to the USAF. In our beautiful Antelope Valley stands @EdwardsAFB. A beacon of ingenuity, technology, and sheer strength.
3/3 W/in this renewal of national pride, we need to think big, stand up & wave the American flag w/ honor & be courageous in the face of stupendous challenges. I am the American dream. But at my core, I am a patriot & the responsibility & role I cherish most is being an American.
Attention #CA25 — please take note of the evacuation point below. Also, please keep all those continuing to battle the #LakeFire in your thoughts and prayers: @LACOFD @Angeles_NF @146AirliftWing @PalmdaleSheriff @RedCrossLA and so many others. twitter.com/RedCrossLA/sta…
2/3 I had the opportunity to address the audience & speak to one of the 3 central pillars of this contract with the American people; Renewing the American Dream. I believe we as a nation are too strong, we have too much potential to limit ourselves to simple hopes & small dreams.
1/3 This morning, I stood on the East Steps of the Capitol Building with @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy, Republican Whip @SteveScalise, House Republican Conference Chair @RepLizCheney, and members of the House GOP to rollout their Commitment to America. youtu.be/HD5twayoBMY
After all #CA25, we’re living in the United States of America, not Venezuela. This op-ed from the Wall Street Journal highlights the risks that anti-fossil fuel mandates bring with them, especially as we enter the height of wildfire season. wsj.com/articles/calif…
Today, I sent a letter to President @realDonaldTrump, asking him to give full consideration to CA’s request for a major disaster declaration. #CA25 and all of CA were hit hard by the recent fires and we must ensure that every resource is being made available to our communities. pic.twitter.com/ixJccGN8LK
4/4 We have the Air Force to thank for standing up the @SpaceForceDoD which we hope finds a home in our beautiful 25th district as well.
 
Again, Happy Birthday USAF, and thank you for building stronger leaders to answer the Nation's call!
Today, I joined @GOPLeader, NASA Administrator @JimBridenstine & small businesses from across Southern California to discuss the different opportunities available to those small businesses through @NASA’s #ArtemisProgram. Thanks to the nearly 150 constituents who participated! pic.twitter.com/3uq4OGMJIM
For too long, Californians in #CA25 have had to live with destructive ideologically-driven energy policies that call into question the reliability and accessibility of our energy grids. We shouldn’t be subjected to policies that drive prices up & increase energy shortages.

5 of 5 This wildfire roundtable was a significant opportunity to discuss what we truly need and our priorities to have complete fire suppression efficacy. We will host more events on a regular basis
4 of 5 Brush clearance, controlled burns, and more fixed-wing assets earlier in these fights. This is what needs to be done to achieve efficacy in fire suppression in California.
3 of 5 We need to fight these fires like we are waging combat: With overwhelming force. The resources we have are well managed; however, we need more, and we need to do more.
2 of 5 Our focus was to advance the alignment between all levels of government as we enter the heart of the envelope to ensure we are getting the right resources to the right battlefronts in a timely fashion for the 25th District.

2 of 4 Matthew Harrison distinguished himself with acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and well beyond the call of duty of a high school student. My heart breaks for all of the victims and their families.
