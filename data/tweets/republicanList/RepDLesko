While @realDonaldTrump has taken historic steps to bring peace & stabilization in the Middle East, Speaker Pelosi writes them off as a ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù while her party holds up relief bills to help Americans. It‚Äôs incredible just how far House Dems will go to attack the President.
Just after President @realDonaldTrump's Administration brokered the Israel-Bahrain peace deal, the UAE, Bahrain, and Israel are officially signing the Abraham Accords, the first peace agreement in the Middle East in 25 years!

Pelosi says the House will stay in session until we reach a deal on COVID-19 relief, but will her members even show up? For months, Dems have been absent from work & proxy-voting. If they really cared about our nation, they would show up & do their jobs.
