As we debate and vote on #DCStatehood, here is a friendly reminder Republican @RepJenniffer introduced statehood legislation for Puerto Rico last year...

Wonder why House Democrats have yet to bring this up for consideration?🤔

The level of increasing violence directed at officers over the course of those preceding days and on June 1st required all available options to ensure the safety of law enforcement officers and of peaceful demonstrators.
Thread of the Day ❗️ twitter.com/repdonyoung/st…
"A modified Zoom call is no substitute for the deliberative process of coming together and meeting, which the Congress is designed and intended to do," said @RepMcClintock. 

This committee must return to regular operations. pic.twitter.com/05XUbThUx4
It does not show attention, concern, or consideration of the level of violence inflicted upon U.S. Park Police Officers over the course of many strenuous days. Today, it is important that we focus on providing the entire picture.

Committee Democrats scheduled a partisan event and advertised it as official committee business. 

The meeting, initiated with doctored Committee letterhead, deliberately excluded Republican Members and those directly affected by the topic.

"I am excited to welcome @RepPeteStauber to the Natural Resources Committee. Our prior work together has shown me Pete understands the importance of public access to public lands and active stewardship of our natural resources..."

“If passed as is, the Land and Water Conservation Fund would be permanently reauthorized at $900 million a year. Congress would be giving its seal of approval to reckless land buying,” said @RepGosar. 

Now is the time to be smart with taxpayer money.

Given what has been confirmed by the Congressional Research Service and knowing how this language is drafted, it would be ludicrous for House Democrats to move forward with this bill without amendment," says Ranking Republican Rob Bishop.

COVID-19 has decimated the primary funding source of the Great American Outdoors Act. 

It would be ludicrous for House Democrats to move forward with this bill without addressing any amendment that would shore up these potential revenue shortfalls. 
thehill.com/policy/energy-…
The Great American Outdoors Act would permanently fund the LWCF with $900 million annually, paid for by revenue from offshore oil and gas leases.

A CRS report showed that recent oil and gas revenue is declining, threatening the reliability of the funding.
