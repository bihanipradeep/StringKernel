Anti-America ideologues, like @Mvmnt4BlkLives and their radical supporters in Congress, want to abolish our laws, our police, and our nation. This a radical political movement disguised as civil rights advocacy, and it must be stopped.

The #BREATHEAct would remove police, school resource officers, and metal detectors from schools. It would abolish state gang databases and repeal all juvenile offenses. Is this the Democrat model for school safety?

Democrats insist that taxpayer funds are not used for the border wall. I have a simple compromise: take money from the cartels and use it to build the wall.

The #BREATHEAct would allow criminals to vote from prison, close federal prisons, & abolish life sentencing for even the most violent criminals. It would decriminalize drug use, including retroactively, & defund law enforcement. Is this the Democrat model for criminal justice?
