During National Parks Month, take time outdoors to enjoy the beauty of our country. In my hometown, Hot Springs National Park is a great place to learn Bathhouse Row's history or get a workout by hiking to the top of West Mountain. Visit findyourpark.com to locate a park! pic.twitter.com/c5v6M9KwSK
Today marks 100 years since the #19thAmendment was ratified, giving every American - male or female - the right to vote.

The U.S. Post Office isn't going anywhere, and the bill we're voting on today has nothing to do with a fair election.

Today I got to spend some time in Hot Springs, with the first stop at Tanner's Sports. They shifted their operations this spring into making face masks that meet CDC standards and are still breathable enough for athletes to wear. pic.twitter.com/eQohd37dP3
I was also able to visit the Hot Springs Police Department and thank them for their continued service to the community. While many people can work from home, they are always on call to serve and protect. pic.twitter.com/WOmAS2ENIU
Finally, I wrapped up the day at Crystal Ridge Distillery. They immediately shifted gears a few months ago from producing moonshine to bottling hand sanitizer.

Thank you to these and so many other Arkansans who have kept our economy running during COVID-19! pic.twitter.com/gcBGnKoJRg
I continued my #EverydayHeroes visits today with stops at a @TysonFoods plant and the Ouachita Forest. Tyson has been instrumental in keeping our food supply chain up and running, and the U.S. Forest Service has continued managing our public land during the pandemic. Thank you! pic.twitter.com/T5PNMboicl

It's #NationalForestWeek! Forests clean our air, purify our water, provide wildlife habitats and give us endless places to explore.

We hear a lot about electric vehicles, but what would they do for greenhouse gas emissions? The answer is not as much as my colleagues across the aisle would like you to believe.

Fossil fuels still back wind and solar. We need to instead work on next-generation nuclear energy. pic.twitter.com/zHdynlAaQv

Water resources tend to be out of sight and out of mind, but thatâ€™s exactly why WRDA is so important. We need sound, bipartisan legislation to keep American infrastructure running smoothly.

WRDA's passage in the House today is one more step toward getting it signed into law! pic.twitter.com/8o0oLsnqSK
WRDA 2020 will:

ðŸ’§Provide streamlined construction authority for communities that experience repetitive flood loss
ðŸ’§Support rural areas and levee districts as they partner with the Corps
ðŸ’§Enact long-term solutions to keep our communities safe from flooding
ðŸ’§And much more! pic.twitter.com/BlAJicwSJx

To get our economy back up to speed, cheap, widespread COVID-19 testing is absolutely necessary. I recently sent a letter to @SteveFDA urging him to revise guidance for antigen tests. We already have this technology, so why isn't it more available?
