After years of instability, @POTUS has secured another historic peace deal in the Middle East.

Israel and Bahrain's diplomatic breakthrough will lead to a safer and more secure world.

...Yet Pelosi is so consumed by politics that she said these peace deals are "a distraction."
Thanks to Operation Warp Speed, we are harnessing the full power of American ingenuity to defeat the coronavirus.

Democrats want to defund, dismantle, and destroy America's economy with more Washington control over your paycheck and your business.

Republicans have tried for months to deliver another round of immediate relief for American families.
 
... But Democrats continue to obstruct.
 
The American people deserve better than the games and the partisanship they've seen from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.

Under Operation Warp Speed, America is on track to produce a safe + effective COVID-19 vaccine in record time.
 
“As doctors, we know vaccines won’t be approved if they’re not safe.” - @gopdoccaucus pic.twitter.com/UChknHabUH
Speaker Pelosi: “People will do what they do.” -7/9/20

Why didn't she condemn the riots and violence months ago? 

She’s only weighing in now because Democrats’ poll numbers are dropping after they refused to denounce this lawless behavior when it counted. twitter.com/thehill/status…
The Trump Administration is leading an all-hands-on-deck mission to develop a safe COVID-19 vaccine.

A safe and effective vaccine is our way back to normal, and Operation Warp Speed is taking us there in record time.
