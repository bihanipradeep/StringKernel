Thanks to @POTUS regulatory reduction and prioritization of testing, the private sector‚Äôs speed and skills to create the needed tests, and the collaboration between the two, America has conducted more than twice as many tests as the next leading country. (2/2) pic.twitter.com/iRdjN1MiPJ
Happy #NationalNursesDay to all Hoosier nurses who have been working tirelessly on the frontlines of coronavirus. Thank you for seeing your patients + their families through this difficult time and for always putting others first. We are eternally grateful.

To date, Hoosier small businesses have received over $9 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to pay hardworking employees and get through this pandemic. sba.gov/sites/default/‚Ä¶ @SBAgov
I‚Äôm excited to see that thru the CARES Act, schools can apply for funds to provide students w/ laptops or hotspots so all can succeed while distance learning. We have a long way to go to solve this problem, but this is a great step in the right direction: indystar.com/story/news/edu‚Ä¶

Instead of helping Americans get back to work, we are voting on Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs wish list which includes funding for sanctuary cities, bailing out states, preventing state voter ID requirements, and more wasting of taxpayer dollars ‚û°Ô∏èbit.ly/2T949nC
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve continued pushing for passage of my DRIVE-Safe Act, legislation to open up more driving industry jobs to Hoosiers at a time when we all want to see higher employment and wages ‚Üí hollingsworth.house.gov/news/documents‚Ä¶ #NTDAW2020 twitter.com/RepTrey/status‚Ä¶

Nancy Pelosi: How about we give you $25 billion in more taxpayer money (on top of the $10 billion just received from Treasury) and a law that says you can't change anything that isn't working? twitter.com/RepTrey/status‚Ä¶
USPS: We have lost $78 billion in twelve years. Mail volumes are down to 1985 levels but addresses are at an all time high. 23% fewer people are coming into the post office to buy things, but post office locations are only down 4%.
Our small businesses up and down #IN09 are home to some of the hardest working people I‚Äôve met. They‚Äôre providing for their families, employees, communities, and the future of our Hoosier economy.
