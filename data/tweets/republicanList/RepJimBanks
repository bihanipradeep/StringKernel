.@SpeakerPelosi has the House of Representatives voting on 15 bills renaming post offices today.
 
Very pressing!
The Republican Party is the party of the working class.
As a father of three young daughters, I find “Cuties” sickening. Glad to join @SenTomCotton in calling on the DOJ to bring charges against Netflix for distribution of child pornography. dailycaller.com/2020/09/11/gop…
No better time to target malign foreign influence than weeks before an election.
 
Read why @RepublicanStudy's @RepMikeJohnson, @RepJoeWilson and I are urging Congress pass the Countering Chinese Propaganda Act.

The Chinese Communist Party uses *slave* labor to drive Americans out of work, but President Trump is fighting back. 
 
By banning imports from Xinjiang, we are fighting FOR American interest and AGAINST international slavery. Win-win!

The APA says kids 5 & under should be limited to 1 hr of screen time daily. But schools now require kindergartners to be online all day.😕😕

The #CCP disinformation campaign targets our classrooms, our news outlets, our social media platforms—they even want to our rewrite our Bibles to include ‘socialist characteristics.' We need to fight back. A new bill by @RepublicanStudy via @BreitbartNews breitbart.com/politics/2020/…
It’s mind boggling that a 30+ year old spacecraft is still churning out data like this. Hubble was launched in 1990! #Hubble30

We shouldn’t be afraid to call “Cuties” what it is. It is Child Pornography.

That’s why @SenTomCotton and I are calling on DOJ to take legal action against Netflix. #CancelNetflix pic.twitter.com/wNfuDCbeuh
I hope the President will nominate Amy Coney Barrett and the Senate confirms her before the end of the year.
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for continuing to deliver on your commitments to the American people. I hope the Senate GOP will do the same. twitter.com/realdonaldtrum…
The 1619 Project teaches that America, at its core, is an irredeemably racist nation. This is an absurd recasting of the birth of our nation, and it’s completely false.  
In June, I wrote about how this idea is fueling the unrest in our streets: americanmind.org/post/exclusive…
When will @SpeakerPelosi denounce the leftists cheering for the death of police officers?

The leadership of the New Democratic Party is 100% incapable of criticizing its radical wing.

Shows who's really in charge!

The GOP is a party with a plan.
 
The Democrats are a party with a mob.
 
I know which side I’d rather be on.

Thx to the 33 Republicans who joined me in calling on DOJ to prosecute Netflix for distributing Cuties, which is child porn... No Dems though.

They seem to prefer defending Cuties to criticizing it. I don't get it. How can you support this filth??

If only this sort of courage was more common. It’s shocking the number of firms that currently profit off of slave labor.
