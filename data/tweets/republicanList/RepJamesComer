Democrats are pursuing baseless postal service conspiracy theories. The @usps is on an unsustainable path that predates @realdonaldtrump.

Today, @OversightDems used a 5-hour hearing to fight for congressional representation for illegal immigrants - weakening the voice of American citizens in our democracy.

Our founding fathers never would’ve envisioned over 10 million people residing illegally in our country. pic.twitter.com/QYwlEXrIA9
Democrats are using the postal service as a scare tactic. The issue with mail-in voting isn’t the @USPS - it’s inaccurate state voter rolls.

Absentee voting is valid. But universal vote-by-mail would send ballots to millions of inactive voters - jeopardizing our elections. WATCH pic.twitter.com/8txyY7MsO5
.@OversightDems 5-hour postal hearing found no wrongdoing and proved that the @USPS has the resources to deliver mail-in ballots.

Under @realDonaldTrump’s leadership, the @uscensusbureau is following the Constitution and counting every person in the U.S.

But states with high illegal immigrant populations shouldn’t be rewarded with more seats in Congress - at the expense of Kentucky. @FoxBusiness pic.twitter.com/C9rmHNCFsu
Cities permitting anarchy must be held accountable for failing to perform their primary responsibility - protecting public safety. We must have law and order in our streets.

More from my interview on @OANN: pic.twitter.com/6i7Um5W66f
Pelosi’s postal service conspiracies cannot hide a fundamental problem with universal mail-in voting: many state voter rolls - including Kentucky’s - are full of ineligible voters.

In today’s Oversight hearing on the 2020 Census, an expert witness confirmed the obvious: representation for illegals would give sanctuary cities a stronger voice in Congress.

Nancy Pelosi’s manufactured #USPS crisis is a baseless conspiracy theory. 

The @USPS doesn’t need an urgent bailout and has the resources to deliver mail-in ballots. Democrats are using scare tactics to undermine @realDonaldTrump. Read my @FoxNews op-ed: foxnews.com/opinion/dems-u…

DC leaders want to take down the Washington Monument and discard the memory of the heroes of our country’s founding.

These radical recommendations would cancel our history and give in to violent mobs. @MayorBowser’s report should be tossed in the garbage. foxnews.com/politics/jorda…
Peaceful assembly is the hallmark of our democracy.

But when protests turn into violence and rioting, it becomes criminal activity. And the criminals behind it should be prosecuted.

Discussed Democrat @USPS scare tactics and conspiracy theories with @seanspicer.

The issue with mail-in voting isn't absentee ballots - but the push to mail ballots to inaccurate voter rolls.

If dead people received stimulus checks, what's to stop them from receiving ballots? pic.twitter.com/xqqovQs0tO
It's all politics, all the time for @HouseDemocrats.

From phony Russian collusion allegations to an un-vetted #USPS bailout on the Saturday between the two national conventions, Democrats don't care about a sustainable, working postal service.

They just hate @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/aiGmXb8bdz
Among my questions for @SpeakerPelosi and @RepMaloney: why are we voting Saturday on a politically-motivated bill to spend $25 billion - BEFORE our committee hearing on Monday?
