PM’d you.
How absurdly ignorant and absolutely depraved must one be to applaud the potential collapse of a commodity which underpins much of our economy. This kind of ignorance is dangerous. pic.twitter.com/KE0ZOa5QL1
Many thanks to the Aeroshell Aerobatic Team for taking the time to say thank you to our first responders and front line personnel in such a wonderful way! pic.twitter.com/F4xakf7LUT
Today I sent a letter to DOJ requesting that funds provided to Louisiana District Attorneys through the CARES Act be made available to cover operating losses due to COVID-19. Our District Attorneys must be able to continue their vital mission in support of the justice system. pic.twitter.com/q2cJD0Aga4
We appreciate all you do, @LouisianaFOP! twitter.com/LouisianaFOP/s…
First responders bring calm to chaos. When they see you doing your jobs, they appreciate it, and know that you are in their prayers and their hearts. pic.twitter.com/t5bPEgjy0s
I’m at Monroe Airport preparing for our flyover of Monroe with the Aeroshell Aerobatic Team to thank first responders & front line personnel helping us through the coronavirus outbreak and recent tornadoes. Be sure to come outside & see these awesome planes fly over at 1:00pm! pic.twitter.com/heMRQxJwEL
Please remember to thank a teacher for their hard work and dedication to our nation’s youth, especially during this difficult time. #TeacherAppreciationWeek pic.twitter.com/C7zm7EiiYZ
Trump has been tougher on Russia than any other president in recent history: instead of smiles and “reset buttons” like Obama, he delivered crippling sanctions and renewed deterrence.
We mourn the loss of life in Rapides Parish as tornadoes ripped through the area overnight causing significant damage to the @LSUAgCenter. I stand ready to support a speedy recovery and ask that we all keep the families of those lost in our prayers. thetowntalk.com/story/news/202…
Tomorrow's flyover of the Monroe area by the Aeroshell Aerobatic Team is to say thank you to first responders & front line personnel who take care of us & bring calm to our communities. Just walk outside & look up at 1:00pm CT to see these beautiful WWII-era planes. pic.twitter.com/2o7IR8ejhw
Thank you to our first responders! pic.twitter.com/delXPetfXP
Thank you, Hannah! twitter.com/GrissomHannah/…
Democrats say they have solutions to the problems minorities face & cast out anyone who votes Republican. They’ve had literally decades to help, but failed miserably. @realDonaldTrump’s social & economic policies are working for ALL Americans, especially minorities! #TrumpStrong
2/2: Abortions nearly always have a fatal outcome for the baby, and many times it’s the same for the mother. Our legislature took morally justified action to protect women and give them the best chance of survival after botched procedures.
Yesterday's salute to our first responders and front line personnel was a heartfelt display of our deep appreciation for our hometown heroes. Thanks to the Aeroshell Aerobatic Team for volunteering their time and resources to brighten our day. pic.twitter.com/MvNn8wH1Bn
Last night, Twitter censored @realDonaldTrump for suggesting children are far less susceptible to COVID-19 than adults - a well-known fact - because it goes against the left-wing agenda to keep schools closed, people out of work, and destroy our economy to influence the election. pic.twitter.com/jcju4j6bBb
No, thank you! twitter.com/nelaems/status…
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions & the compassion to listen to the needs of others. He doesn’t set out to be a leader, but becomes one by the equality of his actions & the integrity of his intent-McArthur #TrumpHydroxychloroqine
Thanks to @MyArkLaMiss for coming out to @flymonroemlu today for the Aeroshell Aerobatic Team flyover honoring our first responders and front line heroes. pic.twitter.com/yISJrWHhBD
Every one of them is a traitor to conservative values and I question whether they were ever Republicans to begin with. Endorsing the party of infanticide who wants to strip us of our God-given right to defend ourselves is simply disgusting. Good riddance! foxnews.com/politics/jeff-…
It’s very suspect of the FDA to withhold authorization of plasma for COVID patients - a treatment used thousands of times every day for various conditions. This should be a decision between patient & doctor. Does someone at the FDA have a political agenda? foxnews.com/politics/trump…
Dianne and I offer our condolences and prayers for President @realDonaldTrump and family after the loss of his brother, Robert, last night. May he Rest In Peace.

A German study this month found children may actually slow the transmission of COVID-19. Out of more than 2,000 blood samples - including 500 from teachers - only 12 had antibodies. Children may not act as “viral shedders” like adults to transmit the virus cnbc.com/2020/07/14/sch…
Yale epidemiologist Dr. Harvey Risch: “When this inexpensive oral medication [hydroxychloroquine] is given very early in the course of illness, before the virus has had time to multiply beyond control, it has shown to be HIGHLY EFFECTIVE” against COVID-19. newsweek.com/key-defeating-…
Doctors like Richard Bartlett are attacked and silenced by the Left, whose only goal is to destroy @realDonaldTrump - no matter how many lives it costs. We should listen to the DOCTORS WHO ARE SAVING LIVES - not left-wing politicians and the media elite. texasscorecard.com/federal/doctor…
I’m looking forward to joining @VP Mike Pence in Baton Rouge today to discuss reopening Louisiana’s schools in a way that keeps both students and teachers healthy while ensuring our young people are able to receive a good education.
President Trump has AGAIN offered help to the cities where senseless shootings claim the lives of our most cherished. I consider those leaders who refuse federal assistance - that would most definitely save lives - complicit in those murders. They should be held fully accountable
Trump has been tougher on Russia than any other president in recent history: instead of smiles and “reset buttons” like Obama, he delivered crippling sanctions and renewed deterrence.
Early and unconfirmed reports of Russian bounties placed on American troops were used by the far-left New York Times in an attempt to embarrass the President. If confirmed, I have no doubt President Trump will respond appropriately, as this behavior should NEVER be tolerated.
2/2: Abortions nearly always have a fatal outcome for the baby, and many times it’s the same for the mother. Our legislature took morally justified action to protect women and give them the best chance of survival after botched procedures.
1/2: The Supreme Court’s decision to strike down Louisiana’s abortion law should have been a clear-cut case for states’ rights. It makes sound medical sense to require anyone performing surgeries - including abortions - to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.
2/2: The same thing is happening with “police reform”-we offered a compromise bill, but they killed it. They’ll use anyone as a political football until it’s time to deliver. They are not the party of tolerance, inclusion, or progress - they’re frauds. foxnews.com/politics/pelos…
1/2: In March of 2018, President Trump offered a deal to extend DACA for so-called Dreamers in exchange for border wall funding - Dems said no. After years of claiming to want to help the Dreamers, Pelosi and Schumer sold them out and we haven’t heard a word about them since.
Today's ruling confirms DOJ was completely within its authority to drop the investigation into General Michael Flynn. It was nothing more than another politically-motivated witch hunt by corrupt senior officials at the FBI. DOJ must hold them accountable! foxnews.com/politics/appea…
Here we go again: the pseudo Republicans of the Lincoln Project are yapping at @realDonaldTrump over his careful stair descent at West Point. The stairs were slippery - is this all they’ve got? True Republicans are championing Trump’s leadership on police issues & the economy.
Another actress I’ve never heard of says she will leave the country if @realDonaldTrump is re-elected...promises, promises. How many other Hollywood elitists have said the same thing? It’s time settle up and I’ll buy the one-way tickets. #WeWontMissYou

The Lincoln Project claims to be a Republican group opposing President Trump, but I don’t buy it. Under his Admin, we have a strong economy, great military, energy dominance, defense of religion/2A, & conservative judges - all things REAL Republicans want. thehill.com/homenews/news/…
