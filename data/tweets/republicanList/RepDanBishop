I take the safety of Americans seriously, so does @realdonaldtrump. We cannot allow anarchy in our streets & failing officials must face consequences for the violence they foment.

Opportunity Zones give under-served communities a chance to propel themselves forward with long-term growth & good jobs. My bill prioritizes outreach and education to drive private sector capital to our communities.

Thanks @RepTimmons for co-sponsoring!
