Capitol Hill is closed. In lieu of constituents flying to us for meetings, I‚Äôm having my staff come directly to you.

Constituent services is my priority. If Washington isn‚Äôt open - we come to you! 

We won‚Äôt be held to the whims of Nancy Pelosi. We‚Äôre here to serve you.

I have joined the lawsuit against @SpeakerPelosi for blatantly violating the Constitution. It is imperative we stop Pelosi and the Democrats from silencing the voice of the People and passing legislation with only 20 members of the House present. #PelosiPowerGrab pic.twitter.com/iUERk23CZF

Nancy Pelosi is wasting YOUR taxpayer dollars on a political postal service conspiracy theory. House Democrats just want to scare the American people and attack @realDonaldTrump ahead of the election. 

ENOUGH with the political theater. pic.twitter.com/6sLA5tlgL7
In any other job, if you don‚Äôt show up you get fired. 

But in Congress you can #Zoomitin from a boat & that‚Äôs OK. 

Congress needs to get back to work in our nation‚Äôs capital. We can do so safely.

In our nation‚Äôs capital today doing the job I was sent to D.C. to do: represent #IN06. Many colleagues are #Zoomingitin to today‚Äôs Foreign Affairs hearing and technical difficulties abound.

TODAY: President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs historic #USMCA trade deal goes into effect. ‚úÖ

This is a huge WIN for Hoosier families, farmers, and manufacturers. #AmericaFirst pic.twitter.com/jwKKQaShMR
Friendly reminder to Hoosiers across #IN06: 

If you have any questions or concerns, please visit Pence.house.gov & send me an email! 

Whether it's latest resources on COVID-19, assistance w/ a federal program, or inquiries on federal legislation: my team & I serve you.

When China unleashed COVID-19 unto the world, @realDonaldTrump saved countless lives with his temporary travel ban. 

The #NoBanAct would undermine President Trump's authority in protecting our country's national security. 

We must not limit this authority & responsibility.
75 years ago, the #USSIndianapolis was torpedoed & sunk, resulting in the greatest loss of life in the history of @USNavy - an unimaginable tragedy.

Today we honor those brave Sailors & Marines with a Congressional Gold Medal. I pray for our service members today & always. pic.twitter.com/kg1aKFNmCW
Too many of my colleagues are giving new meaning to the phrase ‚Äúphoning it in.‚Äù 

They are #ZoomingItIn.
 
I'm frankly stunned at how few people showed up today for the markup of a critical infrastructure bill.

The Swamp attacks @realDonaldTrump relentlessly. The collateral damage in this grotesque war against our President is the American people.

Honored to join so many friends & neighbors in my hometown of Columbus to say a due & deserving THANK YOU to our first responders.

Appreciate Mayor Bob Courtney of Madison showing me the great progress being made on the 421 Connector in #IN06. As we continue to open our economy, this bridge will serve as a hub of commerce between Indiana and Kentucky. pic.twitter.com/CUL0yKOJpC
We expect first responders, frontline workers, food service workers & more to show up to work. 

Yet, Congress is still #ZoomingItIn. 

Hoosiers sent me to Washington to represent them. Here I am.

Congress must fully return to Washington. It is entirely possible to do so safely. pic.twitter.com/u5mgeDSNj7
Today is POW-MIA Recognition Day, a day to honor the heroes who have served our nation bravely.

Today in particular is a special POW-MIA Day in the Sixth District. After 77 years, we bring fellow Hoosier PFC Louis Wiesehan Jr. home.
Hoosiers deserve the best infrastructure. That means making sure our interstates are safe & efficient. Glad to announce an award of $22.5M to @INDOT to improve I-70. Thank you to @realDonaldTrump for continued commitment to our nation's infrastructure.
