@ArgusLeader, I enjoyed today‚Äôs list of 10 most influential SD women. One mistake - Alice Kundert was omitted. She was a legend. Educator, secretary of state, state auditor, legislator, mentor to countless, force of nature. pic.twitter.com/Z3s8t7k2RW
A slowdown of advertisements and subsequent layoffs continue to threaten our ability to maintain a free press.  Today, @collinpeterson and I introduced the PRINT Act to help alleviate some of the burden our print shops are facing. mitchellrepublic.com/news/governmen‚Ä¶
South Dakota patients deserve quality care - that's why @RepSpanberger and I introduced a bill to provide the resources needed to strengthen additional telehealth programs in South Dakota and across the country. dustyjohnson.house.gov/media/press-re‚Ä¶

Here's what is expected in the next COVID-19 relief bill: 
‚òëÔ∏è Additional stimulus check for Americans
‚òëÔ∏è Funding for schools & childcare centers
‚òëÔ∏è Tax incentives for businesses to train new workers
‚òëÔ∏è Investment for testing & a vaccine pic.twitter.com/tqwmiPISIk
Education & work are the key to upward mobility. Unfortunately, today House Democrats voted to prohibit future administration‚Äôs from requiring young, single, able-bodied welfare recipients to work or attend school. I spoke on the House floor on why this isn‚Äôt the right approach. pic.twitter.com/T5t91SiMjk
Our nation needs less fighting & more engaging‚Äì @ASP is a go-to platform where the people can hear directly from politicians on policy & ideas ‚Äì it fosters conversation we don‚Äôt normally see between political parties. You get to hear both sides from Republicans & Democrats. (1/2)

I‚Äôm headed back to DC tonight to discuss postal issues. @SpeakerPelosi, you should keep members in DC until we come to a COVID-19 relief agreement for the American people. Congress can‚Äôt leave hurting Americans out to dry ‚Äì let‚Äôs get to work on a bill that can pass the Senate.
