We can learn from our mistakes. Improvements to our monetary policy strategy for output gaps could mitigate them substantially, reducing their frequency, depth, and duration.
Output gaps are frequently caused, or at least exacerbated by, too-tight monetary policy. While addressing this policy failure cannot solve all problems with the economy, it can mitigate the problem of otherwise-capable people failing, en masse, to find work.
Cumulatively, we lost at least $4 trillion in income and 45 million person-years of work. We should consider this outcome unacceptable.
Improving the system‚Äôs treatment of foster parents would likely increase the number Americans who become foster parents as well as the number of licensed foster parents who continue to provide service. 2/2

As schools begin another year of instruction, policymakers should prioritize giving parents the flexibility to choose the educational option that is right for them.
Americans lost trillions of dollars of income and tens of millions of person-years of work. The job losses were also concentrated among disadvantaged groups, increasing inequality along the dimensions of both education and race. jec.senate.gov/public/index.c‚Ä¶
What are output gaps?
Output gaps are the difference between actual output (what the economy produces) and potential output (the maximum amount the economy could produce sustainably over the long term with financial stability.)
Still confused? Read our latest report ‚Üì
The most recent example of a large output gap comes from the 2008-2009 recession, when 8.7 million nonfarm jobs were shed. The output gap then persisted for about a decade; the jobs were not immediately regained, but rather, slowly added back over a period of many years.
Output gaps essentially involve the cyclical unemployment: the work and income lost to the business cycle. To the extent that output gaps are measurable, one could measure them in person-years of work lost, or cumulative GDP lost over time.

Many Americans are willing to provide foster care, adopt foster children, or both. Roughly 1/4 of Americans say they have considered becoming a foster parent, and among Americans who have never adopted, roughly 1/4 say they have considered it.
Some states do better than others at moving children in foster care to permanent homes. Find out how your state stacks up ‚Üì
2007-2018 Federal Reserve policy erred too far towards curbing the growth of nominal spending‚Äîa stance known colloquially as ‚Äútoo tight‚Äù monetary policy. The result was a long, persistent shortfall in GDP relative to what the economy could have produced with more ample spending.
Only 8% of people who inquire about becoming foster parents eventually become licensed. The majority of those who do become licensed foster parents cease their service relatively quickly. 1/2
How can we fix the foster care system?

States and agencies should review requirements for foster parents and eliminate requirements that have little to do with being a committed parent that provides safe care.

What happened to marriage in impoverished communities? 
Institutional decline, a breakdown of traditional morality, & economic segregation sowed distrust among less advantaged people. That distrust extended to relationships between men & women, worsening the decline in marriage.
THREAD: The mass unemployment that followed the 2008 financial crisis was an economic disaster whose effects will be felt for years to come. ‚¨áÔ∏è
Thoughtful analysts have questioned the constitutional underpinnings of the Federal Reserve. This report does not address those arguments; rather, it proceeds from the premise that the Federal Reserve will remain the monopoly issuer of currency.
Throughout American history, faith-based foster care & adoption agencies have played an active role in helping children in need find homes. However, in some areas, faith-based foster care and adoption providers have been compelled to stop providing these services. ‚Üì
The pandemic need not have the final word; it can be an opportunity to ensure more parents have more opportunity to seek out an education that is not only high-quality, but one that is provided in the context they deem best for their individual needs. üëáüèΩ
Problem: Thousands of American children are in the foster care system & are in need of loving homes. 
Solution: Many Americans are willing to provide care to these children, & many private orgs, including faith-based orgs, lend their efforts to serve these children daily.

Discussions around education funding should include expanding allowable expenses in 529 savings plans, which currently include private school tuition, to include expenses like books, online tools, and tutoring to address these unprecedented circumstances.
