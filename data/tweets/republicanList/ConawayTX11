This is an important step to give women accurate, factual information about chemical abortions. The fight to protect life is never over.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve introduced the #SecondChanceatLifeAct that requires medical providers to disclose to women who had a chemical abortion‚Äî the remedy that reverses the abortion and the baby‚Äôs life could be saved.
1 in 5 women who take the abortion pill will experience complications requiring surgery. Removing restrictions endangers women‚Äôs health and safety leaving without medical care in case of an emergency. #SecondChanceatLifeAct
