During the COVID-19 outbreak, my staff has helped 238 constituents—and counting—with SBA loans, economic impact payments and other pandemic related assistance. I take great pride in my team’s ability to help constituents with any federal agency.

.@RepGregoryMeeks and I had urged the agency to do this in a letter last month. Americans will now have easier access to online shopping, avoid breaking safe or safer at home orders, among other benefits that debit cards offer. More on our work here ⬇️

The #CCP hid what it knew about the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and is now hiding information about its nuclear ambitions. The U.S. must reign in China through effective arms control. tipton.house.gov/media/press-re…
Should the #CCP fail to cooperate with the U.S. or its allies on investigations into the regime's failed handling of the initial COVID-19 outbreak, there will be severe consequences. The CCP will be held accountable—America will lead that charge.

Wise words from Technical Sgt. Johnson, “To defeat this, it’s important to stay positive, help your neighbor and adjust to changes with a good attitude.”

Economic recovery from COVID-19 is going to be dependent on maintaining existing jobs, such as the roughly 1,590 steel jobs in CO's 3rd. I will continue to fight for steel workers who are critical to our nation’s infrastructure and national security. bit.ly/2XTkeiV

It's been three months since the CARES Act was signed into law. We understood then just as we do now that there would be necessary changes and tweaks along the way, but already this critical legislation has helped and will continue to help millions of Americans battle COVID-19.

PILT plays a critical role to help these communities bridge budgetary challenges and I look forward to these funds being used to support essential infrastructure and services that would likely not exist without this money.
Colorado’s Third District is fortunate to have abundant public spaces for recreation and shared use, but given that many of these areas are non-taxable, a lack of tax revenue places significant budgetary constraints on rural areas. twitter.com/westerncaucus/…
