Another opportunity to make a meaningful difference on a critical issue…but instead, the Speaker brings a $1.5 trillion partisan wish list – disguised as an infrastructure bill – to the Floor without bothering to find a way to pay for it. Full statement: bit.ly/2YOOtZV pic.twitter.com/FaU382MYs1

This week, nearly 200 teen advocates from across the country, almost half of whom are living with #cysticfibrosis, participated virtually in the @CF_Foundation’s 12th Annual #TeenAdvocacyDay: on.cff.org/3dzX4nx
Joined @KNPRnews’s Joe Schoenmann on State of #Nevada  this week to discuss my work on the @ProbSolveCaucus & our recent and ongoing response efforts to #COVID19. My full interview here: bit.ly/2xCJEbo
It’s incredibly disrespectful to all Americans when issues for the greater good are put on the back burner for partisan objectives. We’ve seen the results Congress can deliver when we work together: nearly $3T in #COVID19 relief so far. Americans cannot wait any longer.
Now more than ever, we must continue looking for solutions that ensure the most responsible use of your hard-earned taxpayer dollars, & this bill does so in a balanced, bipartisan, and efficient way. More here: bit.ly/2DXaDRQ
In this moment, when it comes to the critical issues in need of a solution, creating political messaging opportunities is the ultimate act of disrespect. Read my full statement on #HR7120 & why I support the #JUSTICEAct: bit.ly/2VlMnPb
This morning, the #SBA announced it has resumed accepting applications for the #PaycheckProtectionProgram. Encouraging all small business owners in NV to head here for more info, including small gaming businesses who are now eligible for assistance: sba.gov/paycheckprotec…

Thanks to WH COS Mark Meadows, Director of the US National Economic Council Larry Kudlow, the @GOPLeader, & the WH leg affairs team for working alongside us to get this done for these deserving businesses. Your individual efforts & those of your staff are greatly appreciated.
Spoke w/ @theNVIndy’s @hsanchez128 this week for an inside look @ the work we put in from start to finish to ensure small gaming entities became eligible for the #PPP  “It may be the most pressure I've ever felt that you have to deliver for your district" bit.ly/3bSHGT8
We’ve directly assisted hundreds of constituents who have already reached out asking for help due to impacts caused by Covid & we stand by ready to assist more. If you or someone you know is experiencing any issues with a federal agency, please reach out as well.

After learning of this issue, my office has been committed to delivering a solution that would ensure the continued health and safety of UNR students & faculty while on campus – so we’re encouraged our efforts have paid off & UNR will receive the full amount of funding requested.

Deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Mayor Ron Smith, a dedicated public servant, a valued leader, & an inspiration to many in our community. This is a great loss for NV & I extend my heartfelt condolences to his family, friends, & the entire @cityofsparks.

It’s been a privilege to work with @RTCWashoe & @FTA_DOT to secure critical funding for this project, and I congratulate them on a job well done! Come on down to Midtown! twitter.com/RTCWashoe/stat…
I’d also like to recognize @BettyMcCollum04, @RepDaveJoyce, and each of their staffs for helping us advance this priority on behalf of the #SilverState. It’s an honor to serve with each of them on the Interior Subcommittee and I’m thankful for their efforts on this issue.

Great news for @unevadareno today! @Interior just announced it will award $12M for the cleanup of UNR’s historic Facilities Services Building after it tested positive for Radium-226 contamination in 2016: bit.ly/2Y27ho1
It’s incredibly disrespectful to all Americans when issues for the greater good are put on the back burner for partisan objectives. We’ve seen the results Congress can deliver when we work together: nearly $3T in #COVID19 relief so far. Americans cannot wait any longer.
So for those angered by the President’s recent executive action on covid relief which includes payroll tax cuts, preventing evictions, and extending UI & student loan relief, please remember that when leadership refuses to work together, the Executive Branch is forced to step in.
Political gridlock solves nothing. At the end of July, Republicans tried to extend unemployment insurance and Chuck and Nancy said no. It’s been nearly 2 weeks and there’s still no deal, no compromise, and no sign of action being taken on behalf of the American people.
Now more than ever, we must continue looking for solutions that ensure the most responsible use of your hard-earned taxpayer dollars, & this bill does so in a balanced, bipartisan, and efficient way. More here: bit.ly/2DXaDRQ
In fact, the @USGAO has even recommended Congress take this approach, stating “the Mint might not be producing coins as cost-effectively as possible.”
Teamed up with @RepJoshG to intro the Coin Metal Modification Authorization & Cost Savings Act, a common-sense and balanced approach that will save hardworking taxpayers millions of dollars annually by allowing the @usmint to modify the metallic composition of coins.
We’ve directly assisted hundreds of constituents who have already reached out asking for help due to impacts caused by Covid & we stand by ready to assist more. If you or someone you know is experiencing any issues with a federal agency, please reach out as well.
In addition to helping w/ UI cases, we’ve secured back payments owed to veterans, worked w/ the State Dept. to help Nevadans stuck abroad due to travel restrictions get home safely, coordinated w/ state & local govs & medical facilities, & helped folks with IRS stimulus payments.
Even when a case doesn’t fall under our jurisdiction, my staff and I will always provide as much information as possible about available resources & point Nevadans in the right direction – so please continue reaching out if you’re in need of assistance.
Constituent Services Update: With my support, NV has received over $3.4B so far for new UI programs & an additional $10M to help DETR offset increased admin costs. While these programs are ultimately handled by State officials, I'll keep intervening on your behalf where I can.
“Rep. Mark Amodei’s office has directly assisted 425 constituents with DETR-related casework issues… Our office will continue intervening on constituents’ behalf, helping them navigate DETR’s system, and providing assistance and access to important resources and information.” twitter.com/ByJonathanNg/s…
