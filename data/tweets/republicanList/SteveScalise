They’re not fooling anyone. pic.twitter.com/3sapxoAWJM
🚨 Disgusting: Nancy Pelosi just called Republicans "domestic enemies.”

I was shot because of this kind of unhinged rhetoric.

Where’s the media outrage? pic.twitter.com/cJZQ3E4dnU
If you can:
- Protest in person
- Eat at a restaurant in person
- Get a haircut in person
- Go to Starbucks in person

Then you can:
- Vote in person

Dr. Fauci agrees.
Dr. Birx agrees.

🚨 USPS leaders have been doxxed and harassed at their homes by radical protesters motivated by Pelosi’s fabricated attacks.

Dems’ insane conspiracy theories and political games have real world consequences.

These are the images the left, the media, and Joe Biden don't want you to see.

They want to silence anyone who exposes the violence and destruction they've been labeling as "peaceful protests" for months.

RT so everyone can see. pic.twitter.com/V2VoS8ug6z
Let's be clear about what's happening:

Nancy Pelosi fabricated a crisis so she can make a money grab to funnel billions of dollars to the Postal Service because she needs it to pull off her No-ID Universal Mail-In Voting scheme this fall.

That's what this is all about. pic.twitter.com/dMC76f3Who
The media won't tell you this story:

@realDonaldTrump was one of the first people to visit me in the hospital the day I was shot by a leftist gunman. He consoled my wife & took care of my family.

He cares about people. It's why he fights every day for the forgotten men & women. pic.twitter.com/Vrxipk3WmL
WATCH: Pelosi says Dems will use the government to keep going after @realDonaldTrump's taxes if Biden wins.

They don't care about governing. They don't care about helping workers & families. They don't care about you.

All they care about is harassing Trump. This will NEVER end. pic.twitter.com/BuS9Qfb4GQ
Make no mistake: Dems are using the virus to try to ram through the same partisan election scheme they cooked up LAST year.

They want to mail ballots to all "registered voters."

Yet at least 378 counties have more "registered voters" than voting age citizens.

Let that sink in. pic.twitter.com/cUMrwLmmrp
🚨 Today in Pelosi's House:

Dems called an "emergency" session to play politics and hand USPS $25 BILLION of taxpayer money.

What they're not telling you: They don't need it—USPS has $12B+ in the bank.

Will the media tell families and small businesses with $0 in the bank this? pic.twitter.com/9FJNY0xm6C
Burning cities to the ground is not "peaceful protesting"—no matter how many times the media calls it that.

But the Dems who run these cities are too scared to stand up to the mobs to stop it.

What's worse—they embrace it.

Thank God @realDonaldTrump respects LAW AND ORDER. pic.twitter.com/G10zk3tjow
Dear Dems having a meltdown over Republicans' Jobs-Focused, Law & Order-Focused America-First agenda:

Your platform mentions President Trump more than it mentions jobs or safety or recovery.

It's clear. → Dems' only agenda is attacking @realDonaldTrump—not working for YOU! pic.twitter.com/iuWuCdhMJ3
Disagree with what far-left radicals and the mobs say and you get canceled and attacked in the streets.

That would be the reality in every city in America if Democrats get complete control. pic.twitter.com/IUgbbmE9uU
I was just with @realDonaldTrump in Lake Charles talking to folks recovering from Hurricane Laura.

The President made it clear: He'll get our communities the help needed to rebuild.

It's all hands on deck—from the White House to the local level. We'll get through this together. pic.twitter.com/kbJ7KeimkG
You won't hear this on CNN: The OBAMA/BIDEN administration removed nearly 12,000 blue mailboxes in their last four years alone.

Where was the outrage from Dems then?

Oh that's right. There wasn't any. Because this isn't a real crisis. Just more of Pelosi's political games. pic.twitter.com/oY9vwtOzv8
Dems and the media expect you to believe their No-ID universal mail voting scheme isn't a mess.

What a joke.

FACT → Most states admit over 10% of their voter rolls are inaccurate—that means millions of ballots floating around ripe for fraud under Pelosi's system. pic.twitter.com/pkk21gPyNY
The far-left radicals’ takeover of the Democrat Party is complete.

Joe Biden & Kamala Harris will try to tell you otherwise—but look at what they now embrace:

- Defund police
- Socialist healthcare
- AOC’s Green New Deal
- Free benefits for illegal immigrants
- Gun confiscation pic.twitter.com/I9e3DWGHgM
CUOMO EXPOSED:

– Despite objections from nursing homes, he ordered them to admit COVID positive seniors

– He used shady math to cover up the deaths

– Nursing homes that refused the order kept quiet out of fear, saying “I know how vindictive [Cuomo] is.” wsj.com/articles/cuomo…
If you can:
- Protest in person
- Eat at a restaurant in person
- Get a haircut in person

Let’s be clear about what’s going on:

Republicans are trying to deliver aid to workers/families/students.

But yet again, Dems are blocking it with partisan demands.

They see this entire crisis as leverage to implement their left-wing political agenda.

Twice in one interview Biden says “yes” & “yes absolutely” to questions about “redirecting” police funding.

Dems & their partners in the media want to blame “editing” to pretend this isn’t exactly what he believes.

Toured damage from Hurricane Laura with President Trump today. Louisiana is full of tough, resilient people. We’ve proved that before and we’re already proving that again.

Thank you @realDonaldTrump for pledging your full support!
Dems didn't even consider condemning the mobs until their political "focus groups" and "poll numbers" forced them to.

They don't care about your safety or your property. They care about their politics. That's it. pic.twitter.com/cqCJyw6I4k
🚨 Joe Biden's America: Elderly couples, families, and Members of Congress like @RandPaul attacked at the White House.

For weeks Democrat politicians and the media have embraced and stirred up the mobs.

We've seen the consequences.

At what point will they condemn the violence? pic.twitter.com/SDWgKEIYZd

Even top Democrats know @realDonaldTrump would absolutely crush Joe Biden on a debate stage.

So they're desperate to keep him hidden in his basement until the election.

Pathetic. pic.twitter.com/wUvS8Xu7GI
Joe Biden wants to have it both ways.

He wants to embrace the far-left.

But he doesn’t want to say “defund the police.” 

So he says he’s going to “redirect” police funds instead.

I know Democrats think Americans are stupid. But he’s not fooling anyone.
🚨 HUGE → @TheJusticeDept is demanding data from Cuomo and the other Democrat governors who forced COVID patients into nursing homes.

Investigations into their deadly orders could be coming under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act.
