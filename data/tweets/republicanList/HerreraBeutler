Too many Southwest Washington residents use their tax refunds to pay their bills & feed their families to still be waiting for them five months after filing.

I’m going to keep pushing our congressional leaders to come to the negotiating table so we can deliver common-sense relief that will positively impact communities throughout Southwest Washington.
It’s unacceptable that Congress has not stepped up to the plate to extend vital job saving programs – like the Paycheck Protection Program – to help our employers keep workers paid so they can continue to provide for their families. chronline.com/community/herr…

It's clear to anyone of any political leaning that Portland's elected leadership has failed its citizens. 

To the mayor and to the governor, I add my voice to that of those from all political stripes when I say, enough is enough.
Some of the most progressive groups in Portland, including the Democratic Socialists of America & the Portland Resistance, are calling for the mayor to resign because of the violence in the streets of that city.
