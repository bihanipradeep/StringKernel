@RepLoudermilk
@RepBuddyCarter
@RepDrewFerguson
@AustinScottGA08
@RepRickAllen
EAC Commissioner Christy McCormick
And all the local election officials
RM Davis outlines 2 main concerns w/ HR 4990: 
1. It weakens the independent, bipartisan EAC & gives power to an agency that is not politically balanced. 
2. Slows any possibility of providing guidelines for non-voting equipment. youtube.com/watch?v=-QsG_a‚Ä¶
Additionally, @RepLeeZeldin @RepTomReed @RepStefanik  & Rep. Chris Jacobs joined today's virtual roundtable to discuss the challenges their local election administrators are facing in New York.
"My bill, the EASE Act, not only will help local officials prepare for safe in-person voting, but would also help states clean their voter rolls to prevent possible fraud. I hope House Democrats will consider passing this bill when Congress returns next week."
"This continues to be a major concern, especially when states like California have been sued for failing to update their voter rolls but are mailing live ballots to every registered voter...
"We heard from a local election official in Suffolk County where an absentee ballot application was received for someone who had passed away months ago. Luckily that was caught and it wasn't a live ballot...
