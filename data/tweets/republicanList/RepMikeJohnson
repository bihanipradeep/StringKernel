Everyone should first take a few minutes to study what history ACTUALLY says about¬†this¬†specific situation. The bottom line: When a president is in his last year in office, and his party controls the Senate, election-year nominees get confirmed.

First Lady Melania Trump did a great job tonight. She's a truly humble & gracious person, but takes such unfair abuse from the media constantly. We loved hearing her highlight her work for children, the achievements of immigrants like herself & the greatness of America. #BeBest pic.twitter.com/19aL7EWPrJ

Amy Coney Barrett would be the ideal SCOTUS nominee. She is a brilliant jurist & an intellectually consistent conservative who reveres the Constitution. I've known her since high school in LA as an exceptional person of faith & the highest moral integrity.
We're receiving some very concerning updates from @fema and the @NHC_Atlantic. PLEASE TAKE THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS FOR THIS ONE. #HurricaneLaura #louisianastrong pic.twitter.com/9Acrv0DA4X

It would be difficult to overstate the scope of the hurricane devastation in Lake Charles. I spent the day making certain that @realDonaldTrump, @DHS_Wolf, & top @WhiteHouse staff understand what we witnessed in Calcasieu Parish is also being experienced in our other parishes. pic.twitter.com/OJ4g8XB8Ha

LA needs your prayers. Hurricane Laura has almost completely destroyed the southwest corner of our state & has caused severe damage as far as our northern border with AR. There is no simple fix, but by God's grace, we will rebuild our communities together.

We started at dawn today to visit parishes hit hard by Laura. I met with elected officials in Natchitoches, Sabine, Bienville, Union & Claiborne Parish.

They get it, & they have committed to do everything humanly possible to help us NOW. My staff & I are headed north through the district, with stops to check on our local & state officials at disaster relief command centers.

This storm was strong, but our people are stronger!
