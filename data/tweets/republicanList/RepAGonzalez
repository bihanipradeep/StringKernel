We must partner long overdue USPS reforms alongside funding to ensure a successful postal service for the millions of Americans relying on it every day. anthonygonzalez.house.gov/news/documents…
While it is vital that we provide additional funding to ensure continued operations beyond that point, doing so without also addressing USPS’ significant business model problems and financial instability is irresponsible and ineffective.
