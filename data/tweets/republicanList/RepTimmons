MYTH: USPS will not be able to handle the volume of election mail

FACT: According to USPS, If 330 million ballots were returned by mail, that would only be 75% of what USPS delivers in one single day. pic.twitter.com/HtoX7QVX2E
MYTH: The Postal Service will be insolvent prior to Election Day

FACT: USPS itself admits it is financially solvent until at least August 2021. The CARES Act also included a $10 billion loan for USPS. There has been no “defunding” of USPS. In fact, quite the opposite. pic.twitter.com/dgazMCNH9J
I would love @MayorBowser to speak out against the "Working Group Report". Page 22 includes remove as a recommendation. mayor.dc.gov/sites/default/…
That is why I am proud to introduce legislation with @RepDanBishop to help direct small businesses to open their doors in Opportunity Zones. Read more about our new bill here: timmons.house.gov/media/press-re…

Hundreds of F-16s will be made right here in South Carolina in the years to come, sustaining thousands of jobs and requiring additions to the existing workforce.

The Africa region is certified wild polio-free! Now 90% of the world’s population – are free of the wild poliovirus. Learn how @Rotary, @ShotAtLife, @CDCgov, @USAID, and partners make it happen: EndPolio.org shotatlife.org #EndPolio
The IRS has issued $230 billion in EIP payments. Unfortunately, we have heard from folks in SC who have yet to receive theirs. We are calling on the IRS Commissioner and Treasury Secretary to quickly identify and provide payments to those remaining families and individuals. pic.twitter.com/ZIc1rw0rKR
This could create a dangerous situation in our area. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take action quickly. Be safe!
To say that universal vote by mail is not ripe for fraud is flat out false. We cannot hold elections this way now or ever. (5/5)

Happy birthday to my good friend, mentor, and fellow South Carolinian @SenatorTimScott. Sarah and I hope you have a wonderful day! pic.twitter.com/L6K3Ei5lrC
Hurricane Sally is slowly moving inland, bringing heavy rain and potential flooding to the Upstate. A Flash Flood Watch remains in effect for our area from Thursday morning through Friday morning, with the potential for rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts.
While these are unprecedented times, taxpayers cannot continue to foot the bill of bailouts time and time again. We must allow the Postmaster General to make the necessary market-oriented reforms needed to stop the Postal Service from hemorrhaging money.
Complicit mayors and governors have allowed the increasing violence and anti-police fervor to go on for far too long in our country. Law and order must return to our cities and streets.
Senate Democrats just blocked critical COVID-19 relief legislation to help Americans still battling COVID-19. They voted against hundreds of billions of dollars to help kids safely return to school, increase testing, enhance unemployment insurance, and continue the #PPP.

Opportunity Zones are a bipartisan initiative to encourage investments by private companies into some of our most economically-distressed communities and have the potential to be the most meaningful anti-poverty initiative since the “Great Society.”
I'm all in on uniting but we cannot tear down the Washington Monument to get there. Let's meet for coffee and discuss further. I am confident that we agree on more than we disagree.

I thought we had seen it all this year, but now the Mayor of DC wants to remove the Washington Monument, and the Speaker of the House broke into a hair salon while her state was still on lockdown. Is it 2021 yet?

Freddie from our District Team joined @NATAaero and community leaders at Greenville Downtown Airport @KGMUairport this week to discuss the vital role of general aviation and rural airports in economic development, job recovery and creation, and even emergency response. pic.twitter.com/GLYApHsVaQ
There is a clear difference between totally partisan messaging bills and serious legislation that passed unanimously. If something passes with the support of every member in one chamber, it should immediately be brought to floor for a vote by the other.
I call on Speaker Pelosi to immediately bring this bill to the floor.
Every day, America loses 20 veterans to suicide. The Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act would help our veterans get the mental health care they need and already passed the Senate unanimously. But House Democrats have failed to hold a vote on this important legislation.
Sarah and I will be praying for the entire Hipp family.
We are very saddened to learn Hayne Hipp has passed away. Hayne and the Hipp family helped transform the Greenville area into the wonderful place to live, work, and raise a family that we know today. His decades of philanthropic service have impacted countless South Carolinians. twitter.com/GreenvilleNews…
These are not protestors. This is an angry mob spewing with hate and vitriol for anyone who disagrees with them. They even attacked a police officer. Will Democrats condemn this? I’ll wait. twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/s…

This week, I joined an amicus brief along with other Republican members of the SC delegation in support of Governor McMaster’s SAFE Grant program. Now more than ever, parents need to have control over their child’s education—not unions. South Carolina students need school choice.
