No one needs Netflix. Pedophile is not a sexual orientation. It‚Äôs appalling that they would produce or distribute content that advances this agenda. Meanwhile, California & others advance laws that protect the sick and make kids even more vulnerable. These ideas must be defeated.
I'm proud to defend our nations' police officers and the #FirstAmendment. Mob intimidation is not the same as the right to peaceably protest and we cannot let this trend toward mob violence undermine the rule of law. pic.twitter.com/B1iZpf6uLH

Exhibit A on why vote by mail systems require more controls to prevent fraud. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court is undermining election security, and extending an open invitation for fraud. This is even more flawed than their ridiculous election influence operation from 2018. twitter.com/keithrothfus/s‚Ä¶
This past week I joined this letter calling on AG Barr & DOJ to follow the money, find the conspirators funding these hostile actions, and bring them to justice. Americans were unified in their reaction to George Floyd. Agitators & media have divided us. thefederalist.com/2020/09/10/hou‚Ä¶

Nineteen years ago, nineteen evil men killed nearly 3,000 innocent Americans. My prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who died nineteen years ago today. 

America has not forgotten.
