The U.S. should take a global leadership role in developing AI. Doing so will help put our country on a stronger footing as we recover from the coronavirus pandemic and rebuild towards a better future. That's why I joined @HurdOnTheHill's resolution as an original cosponsor. twitter.com/HurdOnTheHill/‚Ä¶
This Easter Sunday, may we reflect on the importance of faith as we remember the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. He is risen!

Violence and riots have continued throughout our country in cities like Portland and Seattle. For nearly two months there's been daily chaos. This, of course, should not be allowed in any city, yet many mayors have refused to stand up. (1/2) pic.twitter.com/lxaIOrWyIU
TX-27: Here's where to get updated information on coronavirus developments and answers to FAQs:

@TexasDSHS | dshs.texas.gov
@CDCgov  | coronavirus.gov
cloud.house.gov

If you need further assistance, don't hesitate to contact my office.
The government acted to effectively shut down our economy to fight the coronavirus. So, it is critically important that we provide this much needed assistance to the American people as quickly as possible to act as a bridge to the other side of this crisis. (2/2)
Many have faced economic and physical hardships as a result of COVID-19. I volunteered with @foodbankofGC to help meet some of those needs. Thanks to the folks at the food bank, hundreds of families in the Golden Crescent have been served. pic.twitter.com/aNblfkbkBT
If you were planning to travel to Washington, D.C., please also be aware of other closures in the city, including a number of traditional historic sites:

Mothers make a tremendous impact in the lives of their children through their strength, love, and care. Grateful to my mom and my wife for being there for their kids.

Small businesses across the nation and at home in Texas are suffering as a result of the coronavirus. I've heard from many local business owners who don't know what the future may hold.

There is more in the works, but @SBAgov is offering disaster loans: SBA.GOV/DISASTER
The government of China has taken advantage of the good will the U.S. has shown for years. Now the Chinese Communist Party has manipulated the coronavirus pandemic at every turn ‚Äî in spite of the heartbreaking human toll. 

Discussed the latest with @OANN:

Although some provisions were things I would support, others were harmful, including new burdens on small businesses while large businesses were exempt. The bill language left too many questions unanswered with no opportunity to debate, amend, or even ask questions. (3/3)
We respect law enforcement in our part of Texas but that's not the case in many cities with leadership that has allowed lawlessness. The federal government has sent in forces to restore safety and security. 

The anarchy needs to stop. (2/2)
I toured Goudeau Farms and JD Hudgins Ranch to catch a glimpse of the hard work they put in each and every day.

They're ready for whatever comes their way, whether it's a pandemic or economic downturn. They‚Äôre constantly working to be stronger & better than before! pic.twitter.com/2ZNWFuuLND
The Chinese Communist Party commits human rights abuses against Uyghurs, yet @Disney filmed parts of Mulan in the region where Uyghur internment camps are located. The film credits thank 4 Chinese propaganda departments.

Our office is closely monitoring the situation regarding the pipeline explosion in the Port of Corpus Christi. Local authorities have responded and we‚Äôre actively engaged, ready to assist in any way we can. My prayers are with everyone involved.
It was a pleasure to work with FEMA and Aransas County on the Cedar Bayou recovery project. 

This is one of the many examples where Texas gets it. We understand the importance of protecting the environment and strengthening our local economy.
