Please be aware that 9-8-8 will go into effect in 2022. So If you or someone you know is experiencing thoughts of suicide, please call 1-800-273-TALK.

Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among youth in Utah. Some of my proudest work in Congress has been trying to reverse this. I’ve championed mental health funding & designating 9-8-8 as the #nationalsuicidehotline. We can all prevent suicide. #suicidepreventionmonth pic.twitter.com/rb7UOR4ysu
Spent the day in some of the most beautiful places in my district with local and state leaders. It’s important to preserve access to these beautiful landscapes for all to enjoy. pic.twitter.com/wx5j7WHmMU
Today we celebrate 73 yrs of @usairforce & those who defend our skies. If you know me, you know that my Air Force helmet is my most cherished item in my office. It is a great reminder of the 14 yrs I spent serving in the Air Force & some of the best times of my life. #AimHigh pic.twitter.com/ZM8jao7XpT
Family farms & ranches are the anchors of rural communities. Thanks to all who attended my recent Agriculture Forum at @SUUtbirds, especially those who shared their concerns. I will continue to work to find and implement solutions to the economic challenges many are facing. pic.twitter.com/5t9j5UTqkw
The ongoing pandemic has only compounded our nation’s mental health crisis. Congress must not delay any further in delivering additional life saving resources such as my #NationalSuicideHotlineDesignationAct.

Women shouldn't have to make the choice between a paycheck and having a family. That's why I voted "YES" on the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. All pregnant women deserve the right to work without the fear of losing their job.
Congrats to @northropgrumman on being selected as the prime contractor for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program. This secures  thousands of jobs at @HAFB. #GBSD is a key component in defending our nation.  
standard.net/news/military/…
With the much needed attention on suicide prevention, I call on my colleagues in Congress to make mental health resources more accessible by passing my #NationalSuicideHotlineDesignationAct.
Too often we are faced with the awful reality of suicide. In Utah, we have seen some of the highest suicide rates in the nation, especially among our youth. This #WorldSuicidePreventionDay , do your part. Reach out to those who may be struggling. Let them know they are not alone.
