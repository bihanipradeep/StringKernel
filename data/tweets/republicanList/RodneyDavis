Today is #WomensEqualityDay, the 100th anniversary of the certification and addition of the #19thAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, which enshrined voting rights for women. Let's take time to honor and remember the brave women who fought for women's rights and suffrage. pic.twitter.com/6j45vj5jd9
As we look back on Dr. King's historic #IHaveADream speech 57 years ago today, may we continue to work each day to make his Dream a reality and form a more perfect Union. pic.twitter.com/HSy5NEfdh9

As part of a team effort with @IMA_Today, @JohnDeere, and @UAW I delivered more protective face shields today to Jersey Community Hospital in Jerseyville and Montgomery Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Hillsboro. Glad to be able to help get PPE where it needs to be. pic.twitter.com/CgHCDoESL4
66 years after the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision, many schools in our country are still facing problems of segregation. The Strength in Diversity Act works to change that. rodneydavis.house.gov/news/documents…
Great to join @RepLaHood to speak to business owners, non-profit leaders and others at the #StateofCongress hosted by the @mcleancochamber. A lot of discussion on the success of the PPP and other efforts to support our economy. I'll continue to advocate for our small businesses. pic.twitter.com/mfwdck96FT
Congrats to the Piatt Co. Mental Health Center on celebrating 50 years! I presented them with a Congressional Record to honor the occasion. Chatted about the work they're doing with a @ONDCP Drug-Free Communities grant that supports the Impact Coalition. Keep up the great work! pic.twitter.com/AL7z82NhSX

Today I again teamed up with the @IMA_Today, @JohnDeere, and @UAW to deliver protective face shields to senior care facilities and first responders. We dropped boxes off at Macoupin County EMA, Morningside of Godfrey, and Meridian Village in Glen Carbon. pic.twitter.com/UZONulR8kf
Thank you to @ICEgov, @DHSgov, U.S. Special Operations Command, and the National Association to Protect Children for making sure our heroes are leading in the fight against child exploitation. voanews.com/usa/war-child-…
Visited the @USPS Processing and Distribution Center in Champaign yesterday. Thanks to Nancy and Larry for the tour and John, the local branch president of the NPMHU, for taking some time to speak with me. pic.twitter.com/tJq5nH0f0l
This is great news. The economic development efforts of leaders in Greene, Jersey, Macoupin, Calhoun, Christian and Montgomery counties will create new opportunities in the region and grow jobs and our local economy. myjournalcourier.com/news/article/S…
Celebrated two occasions at @ConnectTransit last week. @RepLaHood and I announced a @USDOT $8m grant to build a Downtown Bloomington Transfer Station. We also recognized outgoing GM Isaac Thorne as he moves on to a new opportunity. Was happy to see his family and wish them well. pic.twitter.com/AxVifPO3Im
The legislation provides federal grant funding to support voluntary local efforts that encourage diversity & desegregate schools. I’m proud to support this bill because it will provide new opportunities for minority schoolkids & improve educational outcomes & social cohesion.
Thank you to @POTUS for facilitating this historic peace agreement between Israel and the UAE. It will result in closer diplomatic and economic ties. This agreement is a great step towards advancing peace with other nations in the Middle East as well. whitehouse.gov/briefings-stat…
Wrapped up my August Open Office Hours today in Godfrey. We held 14 events in all 14 counties of IL-13. Some were in person, while others were virtual due to my COVID quarantine. We helped dozens with the federal bureaucracy and I look forward to taking what I learned back to DC. pic.twitter.com/YGx7SYk7wf
Following my doctor's advice and in accordance with CDC guidelines I have exited my Coronavirus quarantine. It was great to see folks at my Taylorville Open Office Hours. Thanks to those who came out to share what was on their mind or seek assistance. pic.twitter.com/Rr6yGa2Ibm
Discrimination of any type should not be tolerated, and that’s why federal laws concerning pregnant workers should be expanded. I’m proud to co-sponsor the bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act so pregnant workers can remain in the workplace. rodneydavis.house.gov/news/documents…
Promoting the health & well-being of people with autoimmune diseases is a bipartisan policy goal that I’ve worked on with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. That’s why I’m proud to be recognized by @AARDATweets for our work on this important issue. rodneydavis.house.gov/news/documents…
Sad to hear this news - Gregg was a steadfast leader for @Heartland_CC and will be missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time. twitter.com/Heartland_CC/s…

The inability of NOAA to bring the Champaign County Weather Radio tower back online is unacceptable and puts lives at risk. When severe weather like a tornado or flash flood hits, every second counts. I will continue to press NOAA to resolve this issue ASAP. twitter.com/KevinLighty/st…
Airports have been hard hit by the Coronavirus pandemic as travel for both business and leisure slows down. This additional CARES Act grant will completely remove the local share for this project making it 100% federally funded. twitter.com/WJBC/status/13…
These grant funds from the @USDOL will help the @IllinoisIDES crack down on unemployment fraud and make sure benefits only go to those who are eligible. rodneydavis.house.gov/news/documents…

Thank you to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen for easing trade restrictions on American beef and pork. These changes will lower trade barriers between the U.S. and Taiwan and will create new markets for #IL13 beef and pork producers. wsj.com/articles/taiwa…
