.@RepMarthaRoby has been a tireless advocate for Alabama and her district over the decade she has served in Congress. Our Committee and the nation are better off because of her service, and we will miss her voice in the Congress. pic.twitter.com/j9pif9MmxQ
.@HurdOnTheHill is a fellow Texan and a national security expert. Our Committee will miss his good-natured, yet serious approach to solving the most challenging issues. pic.twitter.com/ymCdNzvHFI

House Democrats‚Äô funding bill is a deal breaker. It walks back our bipartisan budget agreement made last summer and includes countless partisan riders. This messaging bill has NO chance of becoming law. pic.twitter.com/U9EyNukZzX
The bills in this package spend billions on top of the current budget caps; bipartisan provisions are removed; and partisan riders are added. These bills:
‚ùåjeopardize national security;
‚ùåreverse pro-life protections;
‚ùåthreaten energy production; &
‚ùåadd burdensome regulations.
