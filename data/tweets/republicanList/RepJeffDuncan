.@realDonaldTrump wins again. Thank you Mr. President. twitter.com/goodyear/statu…
Wow – from deplorables in 2016 to domestic enemies in 2020… this is shameful! twitter.com/SteveScalise/s…
While even the New York Times has been forced to acknowledge the significance of this accomplishment, @realDonaldTrump will still never receive the full credit he deserves for this groundbreaking peace deal.  thefederalist.com/2020/08/19/wha…
Hey @goodyear, here's another idea. I signed a pledge to oppose calls to defund the police. Would you do the same? twitter.com/Heritage_Actio…
.@Goodyear thank you for listening, learning, and clarifying your policy. This tone and wording, along with the fact that you're now allowing people to respond via twitter is a vast improvement over the message many of us heard from your company yesterday. #BlueLivesMatter twitter.com/goodyear/statu…
.@goodyear is this true? The slide was a "forgery?" A hoax?!? Please explain!! twitter.com/pauljmcwhorter…
Keep up the great work! twitter.com/DepSecMac/stat…

Hey Nancy! Covering up the gray is easy. Covering up the hypocrisy is tougher.

.@nflcommish what happened in LA last night was truly deplorable. The @NFL should dedicate week two of the season to honoring all of our law enforcement officers, thank them for their service to our communities, and proudly proclaim that #BlueLivesMatter losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/09/13/ant…
Historic and monumental! Today marks a new chapter of peace under the leadership of @realDonaldTrump. twitter.com/WhiteHouse/sta…
Good work by the DOJ upholding the rule of law and holding lawbreakers accountable! The violence and destruction must end!

The greatest country in the history of the world should have a better process for conducting legislative work than this. This COVID voting system is complete garbage. Show up. Do your darn job. And lets actually vote on stuff that matters and do it in a reasonable amount of time. twitter.com/RepJeffDuncan/…
I'm heartbroken that we were unable to persuade Ukraine to do the right thing and allow Jewish religious travelers to safely visit Uman for Rosh Hashanah. It certainly wasn't for a lack of trying, and I am thankful for @SecPompeo's leadership and commitment to religious freedom.
This is huge! The agreement is a major milestone for the region and the entire world!

Our nation is resilient! There is still a ways to go, but the great American comeback is underway! twitter.com/realDonaldTrum…
Governments don’t have to choose between allowing religious expression & public safety–steps can be taken to achieve both. I’m hopeful raising this issue will clear the way for some in the Jewish community to travel to Uman for the Jewish New Year.

Sad to learn of the passing of Anderson, SC native Chadwick Boseman. His talented on-screen portrayals of heroes, both real and imagined, helped inspire an entire generation of young men and women. #wakandaforever
The DOJ is right to go after the violence against police departments! Now more than ever, we need to be supporting our law enforcement, not defunding them. We must restore law and order in these communities immediately!

Hey @goodyear, here's another idea. I signed a pledge to oppose calls to defund the police. Would you do the same? twitter.com/Heritage_Actio…
Also @Goodyear, why did you disable replies on your post? Do you not appreciate customer feedback? Are you that determined to shut down discussion that doesn't fall under your per-approved areas? Your not helping your case here... twitter.com/goodyear/statu…
Here's an idea. Since your company supports law enforcement, how about showing it! Free tire rotations for all our police officers during National Police Week, and have all of your employees wear "Goodyear stands with law enforcement" shirts. You in? twitter.com/goodyear/statu…
