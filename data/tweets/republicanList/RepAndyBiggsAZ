I’m leading the charge to remove Nancy Pelosi as the Speaker of the House. The future of our nation, in many ways, depends on the success of this mission. 

I hope all Republicans are united behind this critical endeavor. pic.twitter.com/GZjJCdSt5x
Dr Fauci and Dr Birx haven’t stopped their relentless pursuits to undermine President @realDonaldTrump’s efforts to value and protect all lives. 

They must be removed from any positions of influence over the safe reopening of the United States. nbcnews.com/health/health-…
Remember Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation fight?

The radical left promised the nation that they would do anything they could to prevent his confirmation. And they kept their promise, but thankfully failed with their mission. usatoday.com/story/opinion/…
Dr. Fauci & Dr. Birx have received glowing media adulation despite being wrong on so many predictions & prescriptions for the COVID-19 outbreak.

Dr. Scott Atlas has received relentless attacks for being truthful & reasonable about the COVID-19 outbreak. wsj.com/articles/trump…
Science strikes again on masks. pic.twitter.com/2def65gjw1
I support President @realDonaldTrump and Dr. @SWAtlasHoover's efforts to restore freedom, common sense, and adherence to the science and data of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Thanks for stopping by our great state, Mr. President. As always, we are happy to host you. twitter.com/realdonaldtrum…
Isn’t it past time for Rep. Nancy Pelosi to leave her office as Speaker of the House?

I call upon our leaders in Congress to put forward the Motion to Vacate the Chair that has been prepared and merely needs to be brought to the floor. foxnews.com/opinion/nancy-…
Today was a great and historic day for peace in the Middle East thanks to President @realDonaldTrump and members of his administration. 

More peace announcements may be on the way, helping to create a stable environment in that region of the world. pic.twitter.com/8Ulhn3zfEu
Good work, @MesaPD and @GilbertPolice. Thanks for keeping our #AZ05 communities safe. twitter.com/MesaPD/status/…
Many men and women who serve in law enforcement are everyday Americans who have noble desires to serve their communities. They put their lives on the line to defend our liberties. 

We are indebted to their service. foxnews.com/us/sheriff-los…
I encourage President @realDonaldTrump to expediently nominate a Supreme Court nominee to fill this vacant seat on our nation’s highest court, and I urge all Senate Republicans to confirm his appointment.
Just as Dr Fauci once said, masks (or more like the mask mandates) have become a “symbol” of government control.

And many Arizonans choose freedom over control. google.com/amp/s/amp.azce…
Your mask can't protect you against smoke particles. - CDC

Your mask might not protect you if you've been around an infected person within 6 feet for 15 minutes or more. - CDC

This is why I wrote back in June that the CDC has lost all credibility: washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds… twitter.com/NBCNews/status…
Thankful that this federal officer escaped worse injuries. The men and women in law enforcement around this nation place themselves in harm's way to protect our liberties and safety. Violence against law enforcement will not be tolerated. twitter.com/broomheadKTAR/…
When will Arizona give full transparency about our state’s COVID-19 positive PCR tests?

Recent reports from other states have shown that up to 90% of positive cases are non-infectious/false positives. 

Arizonans must know the truth about the sensitivity of our PCR tests. pic.twitter.com/W6zHLlRFTz
STARTING SOON: I'm about to lead a special order on the @HouseFloor to talk about Restoring Law & Order and Ending Mob Violence.

BACKGROUND: foxnews.com/politics/rep-a…
Arizona’s top health bureaucrat admitted in court that she was not aware of any person acquiring COVID-19 from a fitness center.

There’s been no evidence to back up what Arizona - or other states - have done to their economies and societies. azcapitoltimes.com/news/2020/08/0… twitter.com/claytravis/sta…
Where was this sense of urgency from Speaker Pelosi when she sent the House home for August recess, but brought everyone back for a political vote on the USPS faux outrage? twitter.com/scottwongDC/st…
They will again stop at nothing to derail President @realDonaldTrump’s next nominee.

My thoughts & prayers are with the family of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on her passing tonight. 

Justice Ginsburg served her country for many decades, and she opened countless doors for female attorneys in courtrooms across America.
The United States of America never forgets our men and women in uniform who have been taken prisoner by the enemy, or who have gone missing in the field of battle.

Today, we honor these memories, lift up their families, and pledge to keep fighting and looking for these heroes. pic.twitter.com/qujGuzyabB

May we never take our constitutional rights for granted, and may we always stand for our Constitution,
On Constitution Day, we honor our founders & those who fought for the right to be free and to be governed under this document.

While governors & mayors have effectively taken away businesses through edicts, they do not want to make compensation for their acts. 

They want the federal gov't to be on the hook.
