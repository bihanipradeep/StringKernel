Speaker Pelosi on COVID-19 relief: “We have to stay here until we have a bill.”

Yesterday, 40 Dems refused to come to Washington to do their jobs.

If Speaker Pelosi & House Dems want to get meaningful work done for the American people, they should start by showing up to work.
Proud to support the Holding Rioters Accountable Act of 2020, led by @RepDLesko and @Jim_Jordan, and hold Democratic-run cities accountable so they can no longer stand idly by as lawlessness and violent mobs take over our streets.

It's unfortunate that House Democrats would rather attack the Postmaster General than have a serious discussion about the meaningful reform that the USPS so desperately needs.

As millions of working parents know, child care is a critical component of our national economy. 

This afternoon I spoke on the House Floor about the need to provide funding for states to help child care providers meet the guidelines necessary to keep our children safe. pic.twitter.com/uwJSRVVqhv
