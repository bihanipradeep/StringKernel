Debate on the Speaker‚Äôs partisan #MyWayOrTheHighway bill (H.R. 2) begins in the House today. This wish list is an unserious, $1.5-trillion debt-creating bill that can‚Äôt pass Congress and won‚Äôt do anything for our infrastructure. More info at bit.ly/31tvqpM pic.twitter.com/K7SixbhNdZ

"My Republican colleagues and I remain ready to work on a serious effort to develop a serious bipartisan bill. But like I said, this 'My Way or the Highway' bill is not a serious bipartisan effort." More info on today's markup: bit.ly/2zFQfmB
We are now just two weeks away from expiration of current surface authorization. The American people deserve a long-term path to economic prosperity and sustained infrastructure investment, which @HouseGOP has promised to deliver in our #CommitmentToAmerica

Graves: "My amendment focuses on smart reforms, more flexibility, protecting core functions of the system & ensuring rural America is not left behind... Because the goals of this proposal are attainable, it can actually help our economy and get our people back to work sooner." pic.twitter.com/OHDrrSoFy5
As the markup of Democrats‚Äô #MyWyOrTheHighway bill continues into early evening, a variety of stakeholder letters:

‚ùåopposing H.R. 2 or certain key provisions of it
‚úÖsupporting the STARTER Act or key principles, &
ü§ùurging bipartisanship 

available here bit.ly/2zFQfmB
"The bill‚Äôs top-down approach means less flexibility for states and our non-federal partners... and ignores the outcry from labor & business leaders who strongly support streamlining the project review process & putting in place reasonable limits & timetables.
Investment in our nation's infrastructure is an essential part of rebuilding our nation‚Äôs economy. That is why #CommitmentToAmerica includes a five-year surface transportation authorization as it was written in the Starter Act introduced by T&I Republicans earlier this year.
Only 20 days until highway & transit programs expire. To give states, workers & transportation industries some certainty, Congress must pass a FAST Act extension of at least 1 year. We can‚Äôt allow road construction seasons across the U.S to be cut short or shut down.

For example, one of our STARTER Act priorities is putting reasonable limits on project reviews. Reducing project delays can have the same impact as increasing funding; case in point is the $275 million increase to the Hudson Tunnel Project due to review delays: twitter.com/TransportToday‚Ä¶
T&I Republicans came to the table ready to work on a bipartisan surface transportation reauthorization bill.  But since the Speaker took over the process that bipartisan work never happened & we introduced our major priorities in the STARTER Act.
Just a reminder: federal highway & transit programs expire in just 22 days. Because the Speaker hijacked the reauthorization process with her ‚ÄòMy Way or the Highway‚Äô bill, Congress won't get a new bipartisan authorization bill done in time. #infrastructure
