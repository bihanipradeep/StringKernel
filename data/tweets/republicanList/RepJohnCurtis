Methamphetamine addiction and fatalities have skyrocketed across the United States ‚Äì especially in rural areas like the ones I am proud to represent. I've introduced the bipartisan Methamphetamine Response Act with @RepTjCox to combat this problem. #utpol

Bailing out other cities and states?

Provo, and Utah generally, planned ahead and will weather this pandemic far better than other cities and states. We shouldn't be penalized for other poor management elsewhere.

‚ùìFederal deficit?

Very frustrating to see members of both parties not caring about this. I've introduced a bill requiring all future emergency or disaster spending be offset over a ten year period. More:

I really hope we can welcome more refugees. A refugee is someone fleeing persecution in fear of their life. This is very different than simply an immigrant & opening our arms is a part of our country's DNA.

‚ùìIf #COVID19 mostly affects those 80+, why are we all pausing normal life?

I wear my mask bc I don't know when/if I'm a carrier of the disease. We've learned how to open restaurants & businesses w/safety precautions but won't be able to evaluate fully until it's all truly over.
One of my bills I really like deals with energy storage, and I'm also working hard to promote clean technology overseas-- a real win-win if we can export clean U.S. tech.

Why "no" on the USPS bill?

1. Gave the USPS $25 billion (they already have enough cash [$24B] on hand to operate well into next year)
2. Mandated no more changes + undid any previous 2020 changes

If the concern is election security, the bill didn't help with that.

On media bias:

I don't think we can dictate our opinions based on something we hear on cable networks. Additionally, it's a real shame that so much of our public opinion is based on a tweet or facebook post. It's upon ourselves to dig deeper and seek out unbiased information.
I compliment @GovHerbert's handling of #COVID19-- it's been hard to navigate. We've never seen this before and it has changed midstream. I think he's done a fabulous job at striking a balance and I applaud him turning some of the decisions over to local leaders such as mayors.
‚ùìThoughts on term limits for the House and Senate:

I'm a big fan of term limits. I've tried to limit myself in political office. I was having one of the best experiences of my life as Provo mayor but felt after eight years it was time for someone else to take over.
One of my bills I really like deals with energy storage, and I'm also working hard to promote clean technology overseas-- a real win-win if we can export clean U.S. tech.

‚ùì: Is there a specific plan you support to reopen the schools?

A: I believe the decisions should stay local with mayors and school boards where the local community can have a say.

A: Clearly we've had bad experiences with nuclear testing here in the state. Perhaps there are places in the country where it's appropriate to test, but I'm not aware of anyone who would support that here in Utah.
