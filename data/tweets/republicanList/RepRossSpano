Why is Speaker Pelosi & radical Dems pushing for a Trillion dollar bailout?

It's NOT about helping everyday Americans. It's about covering years of mismanagement & wild spending in jurisdictions like #NYC & #CA.

#FL15 taxpayers shouldn't pay the bill. fxn.ws/2FC7nw5

ICYMI: Ross Spano Helps STEP Improvement Act Clear the House floridadaily.com/ross-spano-hel… via @Florida Daily
ICYMI-- Yesterday, I joined Bill Bunkley on @FaithTalkTampa to discuss two of my #smallbusiness bills that made progress in the House this week and the alarming @netflix release of 'Cuties'.  #FL15

Listen to the interview here: youtu.be/PmS9lPAVTtc
Because 🇺🇸 is worth fighting for! The @HouseGOP's #CommitmentToAmerica is simple and clear. 

We are fighting to:
✅ RESTORE our way of life
✅ REBUILD the greatest economy in decades
✅ RENEW the American dream for ALL

#Happeningnow🔴LIVE:

We are about to begin our #smallbusiness committee hearing, where I will be introducing an amendment to the Community Advantage Loan Program; a bill I introduced earlier this Congress! #FL15

In a letter to @POTUS earlier this year, my colleagues and I stated:

“It is clear that the United States should not trust TikTok or any other Chinese-affiliated social media websites or apps to protect Americans’ data, privacy, or security.”

I applaud this action! #tiktokban twitter.com/commercegov/st…
On #POWMIARecognitionDay, we take a moment to remember the sacrifices  of those who never came home or were held as prisoners of war in defense of our country. Their service will never be forgotten!  🇺🇸 #FL15 pic.twitter.com/ODa9lZIW1E

This is why, I 💯% stand for Law & Order and will always #BackTheBlue. 

This is the real danger posed by the left accommodating #BLM /#Antifa anti-law enforcement narrative.  Such sentiment is a threat to police officers & to ALL law abiding citizens. twitter.com/LASDHQ/status/…

As our economy recovers, it’s critical to provide certainty & assistance to American small businesses looking to increase exports and compete globally. 

The STEP Improvement Act does that & passed the House:

My bill to help #FL15 small biz's export will be on the House Floor today!  The STEP Improvement Act facilitates #SmallBusinesses exports & greater ability to compete internationally.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of Justice Bader Ginsburg. 

Her passion for law and her time on the Supreme Court won’t soon be forgotten. 

May she rest in peace. pic.twitter.com/UTzhN0mpsn
Could not agree more with my colleague @TulsiGabbard on this issue. @netflix should be shamed for releasing this material which idolizes child sex trafficking. #HumanTrafficking of any kind is horrific, especially when it involves children. 💯% support #CancelNetflix. twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/s…
The August #jobsreport shows that while Dems are busy getting their hair done & passing partisan wishlists (that will NEVER become law), President @realDonaldTrump and Republicans are delivering for the American People! 🇺🇸

Pelosi said it back in May & Dems this week said the SAME thing about Trump's Middle East Peace Accords: "Its all a diversion"... yet they are obstructing progress on items important to ALL Americans.
