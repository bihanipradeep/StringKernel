No internet for me until now. But your entry is entertaining.
I worked 14 hours...
The Farmers to Families Food Box Program has distributed more than 80 million boxes to food banks and families in need. I thank @SecretarySonny for visiting Nebraska and discussing ways we can improve our nation's food supply during this difficult time. ow.ly/Gaxe50Bq9zH
NE has the lowest unemployment numbers in the nation, however, there are still room for improvements for certain areas in our community. That is why I worked with the Problem Solvers Caucus to create a COVID supplement, but Speaker Pelosi won’t negotiate. ow.ly/dHRV50BuSNi
I visited the newly opened Omaha Fisher House, and it is indeed a beautiful place for families to stay who are with a veteran getting care at the VA. It is the 88th Fisher House to open, and we're grateful to have one here!

Medicare for All is been hated by Joe Biden.
I am committed to rebuilding our nation's economy by getting Americans back to work, ending our dependency on other countries, and modernizing and enhancing our country's infrastructure. CommitmentToAmerica.com pic.twitter.com/hAUjX7jRAu
While most offices found ways to work from home during COVID, the IRS shut down and are now 3 months behind. This is unacceptable. My constituent service team is helping taxpayers find answers on their much needed delayed refunds and stimulus. bit.ly/2RHX1gM

ICYMI: Gov. Ricketts designated NE as a “Hidden Hero’s” State on Monday, and while our heroes in uniform deserve recognition we also owe thanks and gratitude to those who care for our military and veterans. pic.twitter.com/bNraMd9UoD

USTR Chief Agricultural Negotiator Gregg Doud reports that our AG exports to China are up 8% this year. Great news for our AG industry! @NEFarmBureau
What a historic event! It's been 20+ years since an Arab state & Israel made peace—now we’ve had two in one month. I served in all 3 countries in the USAF. Our national security is stronger when we work together & I hope this creates future peace accords. washingtonpost.com/politics/trump…
Great editorial on our efforts to break gridlock in Congress. #COVID has hurt many sectors in our community & the “my way or the highway” approach is damaging. This was a good faith effort by 50 GOP & Dems to find solutions. I'm proud to be a part of it. ow.ly/v7oW50BsXze
Myself & 49 other members, half Democrat & half Republican, tried to break the gridlock on COVID relief. Speaker Pelosi dismissed our efforts. Her “my way or the highway” approach was a gut punch to segments of our community that were hit hardest by COVID. ow.ly/23B330ra9fV
I fully support increasing funding by $1.75B for better police training, community policing, and equipment to include 500,000 body cameras. This will have a positive impact on community security and restoring confidence in our nation's law enforcement. pic.twitter.com/DTidwqOfTA
What are Speaker Pelosi and House Dem leaders doing this week to help Americans during COVID? Renaming 16 post offices while also shooting down a bipartisan COVID package from the Problem Solvers Caucus, of which I am a member. politico.com/news/2020/09/1…
This year, we passed and the Pres. signed the Never Again Education Act, a bipartisan bill that provides our nation’s teachers with the resources and training they need to teach our children the important lessons of the Holocaust and the consequences of intolerance and hate. twitter.com/guardian/statu…
On Friday, @GovRicketts  & I spoke at the VFW 2503 POW/MIA Day Commemoration. We were joined by Post Commander Larry Quilliam & USMC Master Gunnery Sergeant Terrance Meekins from StratCom to remember those who endured incredible suffering & those who are still missing. pic.twitter.com/CBA6rl2B6h

My prayers are with the family of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who faithfully served on the Supreme Court for 27 years. God bless.
Victory Apartments #2 is a newly opened  rehabilitation project and housing solution for Veterans right here in Omaha. I look forward to the work they will do to care for those who fought for us.
