Barbara Bush was an amazing woman. She was fiercely loyal, funny, witty, and plain-spoken. She was married to the love of her life for 73 years, and together they served our country with grace and class as President and First Lady. pic.twitter.com/qokPkoxnUr
This is incredible news for Michigan! Since @RepJackBergman, @RepPaulMitchell and I talked to @POTUS about the Locks in April, there has been more progress on building a new Lock than has been made in decades. This new funding will benefit our state. nbc25news.com/news/local/753…
Hope you will tune in tomorrow for the virtual town hall with @RepDanKildee. twitter.com/LansingChamber…

The May flooding has affected so many in our region. It’s a long process to get FEMA assistance and I know @realdonaldtrump wants to help the hardworking people of mid Michigan. I will be asking him today to expedite the disaster declaration and help us cut through the red tape.

Shelters for Midland County residents who need to evacuate have been set up at:
Coleman High School
Meridian Junior High
Midland Mall

Mid Michigan residents pull together in challenging times and we will make it through this. Right now, the most important priority is staying safe, and I urge everyone to follow the advice of emergency responders who are protecting our community.
After more than three decades of inaction from Washington, we got this project funded and construction is moving forward. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump, @RepJackBergman, @RepPaulMitchell and my bipartisan colleagues on the House Appropriations Committee for their support. twitter.com/RepJackBergman…
