Ranking Member @PatrickMcHenry: The best way to support state and local governments is through strong state and local economies.
 
Read Ranking Member McHenry‚Äôs full remarks here: ‚Ä¶publicans-financialservices.house.gov/news/documents‚Ä¶
‚ÄúThriving small businesses generate revenues that contribute to state and local tax bases. When people are working, they can support their local and state governments. Unfortunately, Democrats‚Äô partisanship prevents small businesses from accessing that support right now."
‚ÄúDemocrats are using this hearing to claim that states are struggling, but it certainly isn‚Äôt due to a lack of funding. In fact, of the $150 billion in direct aid provided for by the CARES Act ... states had only used 25 percent of their distribution." -- RM @PatrickMcHenry
‚ÄúAnd so, what I think we need is a reasonable compromise to support workers, small businesses, and make sure that we can get people back on their feet again ... so we can get our economy open again and kids in school again," Ranking Member @PatrickMcHenry said.
RM @PatrickMcHenry: "This is also not in our Committee‚Äôs jurisdiction. If you want to appropriate money to the states, there is an Appropriations Committee. We are the Financial Services Committee."
"Here we are again. We‚Äôre having a hearing about a bill the House passed 4 months ago ... The Committee is being used to prioritize Democrat priorities that aren‚Äôt going to become law." -- RM @PatrickMcHenry in his opening remarks at today's hearing on Dems' socialist wish-list
Today Committee Dems are wasting time with another partisan hearing on Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs Socialist Wish-List, rather than trying to find common ground on behalf of the American people who need support.
