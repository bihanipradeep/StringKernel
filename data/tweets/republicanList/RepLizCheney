Why won't Speaker Pelosi hold the CCP accountable for spreading COVID-19 around the globe? Why is she protecting them? cheney.house.gov/2020/07/22/che… pic.twitter.com/J6lnigOeOk
It's important for all of us to keep in mind what's at stake this fall. House Republicans are standing up for freedom, defending law enforcement, holding China accountable, and more. pic.twitter.com/h1QUTZ5Gka

They want to take power & freedom away from the people and give it to the government, which will drive this nation into the ground. cheney.house.gov/2020/08/19/che… pic.twitter.com/ghmHDski5N
Code of the West:
Live each day w/ courage
Take pride in your work
Always finish what you start
Do what has to be done
Be tough, but fair
When you make a promise, keep it
Ride for the brand
Talk less & say more
Remember that some things aren't for sale
Know where to draw the line pic.twitter.com/pT1YRDL5oR

I’m proud we defeated Democrats’ efforts to cut funding for our ICBM forces. Our nuclear triad is crucial and these cuts would embolden China. We must work together to deter and defeat our adversaries. pic.twitter.com/yTmLhLJcha

Democrats are hiding at home because they are unable to defend Speaker Pelosi's refusal to actually sit down and do what's necessary to help the country combat COVID-19, hold China accountable, and more. cheney.house.gov/2020/08/07/che… pic.twitter.com/pazgMHdB2V

According to Speaker Pelosi:

Brokering a historic agreement between Israel & Bahrain = a "distraction"

Holding China accountable for COVID19 = a "diversion"

You can always count on Speaker Pelosi to put her own political agenda before the safety of the American people.
The Senate is voting today on a COVID-19 relief package that provides targeted aid for families and small businesses. Unfortunately for the American people, Speaker Pelosi is still holding relief legislation hostage so that she can pass her partisan wish list. pic.twitter.com/as4aptOLom
