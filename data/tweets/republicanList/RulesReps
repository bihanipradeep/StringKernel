Washington Examiner: A reality-based look at Trump and the post office @dcexaminer

Even temporary changes now become the precedent tomorrow. @HouseDemocrats' plan for proxy voting & remote committee work fundamentally alters House operations, & not for better. No matter how difficult to achieve, changes this consequential should ONLY be bipartisan. @TomColeOK04 pic.twitter.com/vARTFWHVKm
FLOOR ALERT: Not only did Communist China lie to the world about #coronavirus, now they're trying to steal American life-saving vaccine research! So why did @HouseDemocrats just block @RepKinzinger's resolution to condemn their unconscionable cyber-attacks? pic.twitter.com/sT5rW6dCA9
"This is a joke."

"No legislation is going to happen because @HouseDemocrats aren't serious about legislating. No money is going to get to the Post Office because this can't pass the Senate, & @USPS doesn't need it anyway." 
-@TomColeOK04 on H.R. 8015 pic.twitter.com/23MZP4wXpx
HAPPENING NOW: Debate on the rule for H.R. 2 with @RepRobWoodall managing for Republicans. Watch live: c-span.org/event/?473481/â€¦
FLOOR ALERT: @HouseDemocrats just refused to allow a vote on a resolution calling for justice for George Floyd, condemning violence & rioting & urging peace. @RepGregSteubeâ€™s resolution also denounces the misguided & dangerous demands to defund the police. pic.twitter.com/2prPzi2Awd
FLOOR ALERT: @HouseDemocrats just refused @TomColeOK04's request requiring 2/3 of the House â€“ a clear bipartisan majority â€“ signs off on the drastic change to allow proxy voting & remote committee work. If we're going to erase 230+ yrs of precedent, we should be in agreement! pic.twitter.com/BSNk1m9UQn
FLOOR ALERT: Amid communist China's ongoing effort to steal our intellectual property & #coronavirus research, @HouseDemocrats shockingly just blocked @TomColeOK04's request to combat the growing Chinese propaganda machine that's been infiltrating U.S. universities. pic.twitter.com/phjIzr3mC3
FLOOR ALERT: China deliberately concealed the known dangers & health risks posed by the deadly #coronavirus.
 
So why did @HouseDemocrats block @RepJohnCurtis' resolution to hold foreign officials accountable for not immediately telling the world about a global health emergency? pic.twitter.com/4DcwIh7iXw
The committee is now considering H.R. 6800. Continue following along with today's proceedings here: c-span.org/video/?472119-â€¦
Wondering what the Constitution says about how Congress should operate and conduct business? Worth reading this thoughtful piece from @conginst. â†“ twitter.com/conginst/statuâ€¦
Instead of a bipartisan bill to combat #coronavirus, we have an 1,800-page list of $3 trillion worth of Democratic priorities that @HouseDemocrats would be pursuing regardless of this crisis.  

@TomColeOK04's H.R. 6800 remarks as prepared â†“ republicans-rules.house.gov/press-release/â€¦
STARTING SOON: The committee will meet to consider H.R. 7120, H.R. 1425, H.R. 51, H.R. 5332 and H.J. Res. 90. Watch live here: youtu.be/TQVTyxY9jeo
FLOOR ALERT: @HouseDemocrats just refused to consider matters of ACTUAL urgency for Americans â€“ like funding #coronavirus testing/vaccine research, enhancing PPP & supporting the police. Sadly, theyâ€™d rather peddle baseless @USPS conspiracies & waste everyoneâ€™s time. pic.twitter.com/c1sDL2Kt2p
FLOOR ALERT: @HouseDemocrats blocked @RepRobWoodall's amendment which would make it easier to salvage fallen timber after a catastrophic event. We should be doing everything we can to responsibly manage & preserve our forests for the American people. Sadly, Democrats disagree. pic.twitter.com/04ptAh0BAZ
HAPPENING NOW: The committee is meeting to consider H.R. 2. Watch live: youtu.be/VruRgvzDa0k
In a world where deep fakes & impersonation is very real, committees should absolutely have plans in place to ensure that members are really the ones participating remotely. In opposing @TomColeOK04's amendment, @RulesDemocrats are saying they don't think that's necessary.
Lots of opinions on the floor earlier about proxy voting & remote committee work in Congress. But certainly not all of them true...

@TomColeOK04 setting the record straight on some deceptive claims made by @HouseDemocrats â†“ pic.twitter.com/2H6H38tcGp
If @HouseDemocrats insist on remote proceedings, committees should fully comply with House Rules & not expect a safety net from @RulesDemocrats waiving points of order. @TomColeOK04's amendment would've held committees accountable to act in a transparent & fair manner.
FLOOR ALERT: @HouseDemocrats just blocked legislation authored by @RepRutherfordFL & @RepAnnWagner that would protect law enforcement & deliver justice for victims of violent crimes. Unfortunately, Democrats are fixated on making political points rather than bipartisan solutions. pic.twitter.com/xN0XomVYhy
