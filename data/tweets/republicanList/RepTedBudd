I’ll be standing for #LawAndOrder this afternoon as well. 

Thanks to @RepAndyBiggsAZ for organizing this demonstration of support for the men and women who protect us everyday. #BackTheBlue twitter.com/repandybiggsaz…

I’ve proposed more than a dozen common sense conservative solutions on COVID.

We’re ready to govern, but Pelosi’s House is preoccupied by politics. pic.twitter.com/NyJZXQiYLg
One of the biggest lessons that COVID has taught us is the importance of Made in America.

That's why I introduced a bipartisan bill with Rep. @janschakowsky to make sure American companies are making our PPE. budd.house.gov/news/documents…
Nancy Pelosi started this year by shamefully ripping up President @realDonaldTrump’s State of the Union, and she’s ending it by smearing Republicans as “enemies of the state” and blocking anything that helps hard working Americans. pic.twitter.com/zKgGFcjxK7
How we can restore #LawAndOrder: 

- Double the federal penalties for those who riot.

- Strip federal funding from cities that refuse to confront lawlessness in their communities. 

- Put dithering local officials on the hook legally for the carnage they allow to happen. twitter.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ…
Good news: The House just passed my Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act. 

This bill helps secure government devices from foreign threats to our national security.

Keep on flying, fighting, and winning for our country! #USAF73 pic.twitter.com/ls7655Xxh3
I’d like to send my condolences to the family and friends of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. While we disagreed philosophically, her passion for what she believed in was admirable and her loved ones will be in my prayers.
An incredible achievement for peace. twitter.com/thehill/status…
Today we honor and remember those American heroes who were prisoners of war and those who never returned home. 

May we never forget their service and sacrifice for our freedom. #POWMIARecognitionDay pic.twitter.com/njvTkaYPPr
A great day in Lexington...

Proud to join @SenThomTillis & Mayor @NewellClark to announce a historic $25 million @USDOT grant for Lexington's Depot District. #NC13 pic.twitter.com/KKtZOqEOKy
This beautiful piece of art was just delivered to my DC office. Congrats to Eghosa Nadine Ohenhen, a Rising Senior at STEM Early College at @ncatsuaggies! 

She won #NC13’s 2020 Congressional Art Competition and her work will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol Building very soon. pic.twitter.com/TjjdCCJc3Q

But we have to also hold in our memories the heroes who charged into burning buildings to save people they had never met. We have to remember the seemingly ordinary airline passengers who decided to say 'let’s roll' and heroically sacrificed their lives...
We must never forget these American heroes. We must never forget that we are a fundamentally strong and resilient people. It’s that fact that gives me hope for the future. No matter what comes at us, Americans will always overcome...
May God Bless those we lost, may He comfort their loved ones, and may He continue to Bless America. #NeverForget #September11
On this 19th anniversary of 9/11, it is important to revisit why we say #NeverForget. Of course, we’ll never forget the fear that gripped us, the horror that shook us, or the sorrow that filled our souls...
