Democrats aren’t serious about solutions. This is just another issue they’re hoping to weaponize against President Trump in the upcoming election.

My full statement here: clayhiggins.house.gov/media/press-re…
Media: “Congressman, we know that you support President Trump. Yet, he has shaken DC, and made politicians very angry. Why do you continue to support him?”
Me: “Exactly”
Media: “What does that mean?
Me: “I support Trump because I don’t like career politicians & I don’t trust DC.”

Last night, I addressed the House of Representatives regarding Hurricane Laura and our ongoing recovery efforts. While the national media and much of America has moved on, I will not allow the people of Southwest Louisiana to be forgotten in Congress. pic.twitter.com/C8o6KIeOr8
Tore my bicep hitting the heavy bag. 
  Becca is quite upset with me, which explains the pain. 
  In other news, basement Joe selected another career politician establishment weakling as his personal assistant.

During these examples of American strength, the left writhed and wailed. In my considered opinion, courageous decisions made since January 20th, 2017, have set the stage for real, potential stability in the Mideast.
We’ve stood strong with Israel. We’ve killed terrorists. We withdrew from the disastrous Iran deal. Many Presidents and Presidential candidates have promised to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. President Trump actually did it.
While we face a long path to recovery, our people are strong. Together, we’ll make it through this and stand Louisiana back up.
Lafayette and Lake Charles will receive over $2M in Community Development Block Grants. These investments provide flexible funding and allow our local communities to direct resources where they are most needed.
