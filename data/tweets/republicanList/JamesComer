First time in 10 years I’ve not participated in the Fancy Farm Picnic Political Speaking on the first Saturday in August. It was canceled due to COVID.

Called on my Democrat colleagues on Oversight Committee to join me in strongly OPPOSING the movement to Defund Police—the dumbest idea yet from the liberal wing of the Democrat Party. I agree with my friend @Jim_Jordan—defunding the police is insanity! #LawAndOrder pic.twitter.com/ndJlxjxY06
Appeared on FOX & Friends First early this morning and then Varney & Co on FOX Business to discuss WHO, Supreme Court ruling & Presidential politics. pic.twitter.com/f8SZ6RwP7A

I want to thank 62 of my @HouseGOP colleagues for joining my effort to reopen our economy & get people back to work. Republicans want Americans working while Democrats want an endless shutdown! pic.twitter.com/g2ewN5euDu
The 1st picture is what an airport looks like in a state that is open for business (TN) & the 2nd is what it looks like in a state still shut down (KY.) I’m having to fly out of Nashville now instead of Louisville due to so many flights being canceled out of Louisville Airport 👎 pic.twitter.com/Gckyygjg6G
