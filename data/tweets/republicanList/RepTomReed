Enough is enough. This important first step could finally help New Yorkers who lost a parent or grandparent receive the accountability and transparency they deserve.
For far too long, Governor Cuomo and the Department of Health have refused to end the charade and own up to their mistakes, instead opting to obfuscate the truth and promote a medically dubious report that declared themselves free of any blame.
