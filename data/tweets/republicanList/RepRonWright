43 of our law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty this year alone.

My friend @RepChipRoy hit the nail on the head. Why won't the People's House stand with our brave men and women in blue? 

Where is the outcry of support for these fallen officers? twitter.com/RepChipRoy/sta…
Great news! The Administration withdrew the MFAR - a rule that would have a disastrous impact on TX hospitals & health care providers.

In March, Rep. Wright worked with the entire TX delegation on a letter led by @michaelcburgess to prevent the implementation of this regulation.
This afternoon, the historic #AbrahamAccords were signed at the @WhiteHouse, solidifying the peace agreements between Israel, the UAE & Bahrain. 

I applaud @POTUS, @SecPompeo, and the entire Administration for brokering this huge step towards peace in the Middle East.  🇺🇸🇮🇱🇦🇪🇧🇭 pic.twitter.com/2uDmn4191i

The violence happening in cities across our country needs to come to an end. We must restore law and order to our communities.

Great news for Texas! The TX unemployment rate fell to 6.8% in August - down from 8% in July - and below the national unemployment rate of 8.4%.
 
We still have a long way to go, but through perseverance and determination, Texans are heading back to work & rebuilding our economy.
The PPP Program has helped over 110,000 jobs in TX-06.

I strongly support the discharge petition by @RepSteveChabot & @HerreraBeutler that would force a vote to allow access to the $138B left in the PPP & provide much-needed relief to American workers & small businesses. pic.twitter.com/HbGtQsj8HQ

Human trafficking is a crisis that is happening right in our own backyards. 

Rep. Wright is proud to cosponsor the End Banking for Human Traffickers Act, by @RepBrianFitz, which will cut traffickers off from our banking system making it easier to identify these evil criminals. pic.twitter.com/fJI1d87dfs
