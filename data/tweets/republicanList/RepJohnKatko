Today our nation mourns the loss of John Lewis, an icon of the Civil Rights movement who dedicated his life to fighting for equality.  He was an American hero who never wavered in his pursuit to make our country a more fair, just place.  My full statement: bit.ly/32ws85S pic.twitter.com/5uThvvWoK0

Tonight, I spoke on the House Floor to honor the life and legacy of Congressman John Lewis. An icon of the Civil Rights movement, dedicated public servant, and friend – John Lewis will be dearly missed in the Halls of Congress. pic.twitter.com/ocfmYFuB9U
Yesterday, at @flcc_connects in Newark, I worked with the folks at Food Link Inc. to distribute food to over 300 households. It was great to help out and hear that many of the meals we provided were supplemented by the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program. pic.twitter.com/H9QFDPuPyV
In Clay, I toured the site where the new @amazon fulfillment center is being built. This warehouse will be one of the largest in the world and will create thousands of new jobs. I’m very excited for this project and believe it has the potential to transform our region. pic.twitter.com/8d1E5Q0ftq
I wanted to take a moment to wish everyone in Central New York a very happy Independence Day. As we reflect on our nation’s founding 244 years ago, remember that we have overcome seemingly unsurmountable challenges many times before, and can do it again. pic.twitter.com/Yx4oLlsc9i
Today is World Suicide Prevention Day. Sadly, in our country, suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for people ages 10-34 and the 10th leading cause of death for all Americans. pic.twitter.com/EzcrTT3XIc
I urge Governor Cuomo and New York State to immediately provide the public with this information. Families deserve answers.
Great news from Byrne Dairy. This week they broke ground on a new processing and production facility. This project will allow them to expand their local production capabilities and will create 64 new full time positions as well as 125 construction jobs. pic.twitter.com/cYEHDpyGAs
As Congress looks to consider an additional COVID-19 aid package this month,  I’m continuing to lead Republican efforts to deliver aid for state and local governments. auburnpub.com/news/local/gov…
It was great to be on the @FederalNewsNet’s Federal Drive with Tom Temin to discuss my work as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation. Click on the link below to listen to the full interview. federalnewsnetwork.com/technology-mai…
I stopped by Oswego Subshop today and talked with Bill Greene Sr. Recently celebrating its 50th anniversary, this family business is now run by Bill’s son. Today, it still operates at its original location and continues to be a beloved business in the Oswego community. pic.twitter.com/J6yt0e9WIQ
The shooting of two LA County Sheriff’s deputies is reprehensible. We must hold the assailant accountable to the fullest extent of the law, and strongly condemn the actions of those who blocked the entrance to the hospital and wished death upon the officers as they arrived.
Ahead of tax day tomorrow, I led a bipartisan effort with @RepBrindisi to urge the IRS to deploy a strategy that provides necessary flexibility to struggling taxpayers and allows for the efficient delivery of tax refunds amid the COVID-19 pandemic. katko.house.gov/media-center/p…
Today is International Overdose Awareness Day.  Central New York has long suffered from the impact of the opioid epidemic.  We must continue to raise awareness and enhance access to prevention and treatment for substance use disorders. #IOAD2020 #CutOutOverdoses
Today, on the 19th anniversary of 9/11, let us all take a moment to reflect on the memory of the fallen and to pay tribute to those who made incredible sacrifices.

The partisanship and posturing must end. With our communities still suffering from the devastating impacts of the pandemic, Congress needs to set partisan politics aside and work together to deliver relief. waer.org/post/sen-gilli…

By offering support to neighbors in-need, sharing resources, and encouraging those struggling with mental illness to seek treatment, we can prevent suicide and save lives.
If you’re struggling, know that resources are available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline offers free, confidential crisis counseling at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
The economic uncertainty and emotional toll of the current pandemic have only worsened the mental health crisis in our country.  We must continue our work to reduce stigma, increase access to treatment, and reach out to those who might be suffering.

I encourage anyone who is experiencing difficulty receiving the relief they are due to RSVP by email to NY24RSVP@mail.house.gov . In the email participants must include their name, phone number, and address. The deadline to register for this important workshop is Thursday at 5pm.
On Friday at 10:30am, I’m hosting an EIP workshop with a representative from the IRS. We’ll also address issues with the delivery of 2019 tax returns and discuss the status of taxpayer services amid the pandemic. katko.house.gov/media-center/p…

Meal delivery services like Meals on Wheels are more important than ever. That why I’m leading a bipartisan effort calling for $1.1 billion in COVID-19 relief funds for senior nutrition services and other programs offered through the Older Americans Act.

The Presidential Election in Belarus was anything but legitimate. Presient Lukashenko must hold transparent and fair elections and immediately end the violent response to citizens peacefully protesting and journalists reporting on the election.
