Looking forward to continuing this tour tomorrow! #FL02 pic.twitter.com/v3C2A9qnzO

Another excellent day w/ @SecBernhardt! 

Today, we participated in a prescribed burn. Prescribed burns have become somewhat second nature to us in Florida, especially the Panhandle, but many don't realize how essential these burns are to maintaining our beautiful forests.  #FL02 pic.twitter.com/59EBzC0kjO

We cannot afford to let the Dems’ latest conspiracy theory distract us from the millions of Americans who are hurting. With the current pandemic, American families are facing unemployment, pay cuts, health risks, & uncertainty about sending their children back to school. #FL02 pic.twitter.com/qM9piawPVY
Excellent news! The @USDA just announced that all kids will be able to get free meals for the rest of the summer. Thank you to Secretary Purdue & the several individuals throughout the district who are making this possible! #FL02 wtxl.com/news/national-…

The U.S. Dept of Labor has announced that the economy added 1.4 million jobs in Aug -- putting the unemployment rate below 10% for the 1st time since March. This is a positive indicator that we're making steady progress in renewing, restoring, & rebuilding our great nation! #FL02 pic.twitter.com/7ial6oP2Rx
America cannot afford to ignore our dependence on supply chains that include #China any longer. This is a foreign power that is not an ally & must be dealt with through strong diplomacy & a clear-eyed sense of realism. Read more here - newsherald.com/story/opinion/… #FL02
Additionally, the FL Irrigation Recovery Block Grant Program is now available to agricultural producers who suffered damage to their crop & irrigation system as a result of #HurricaneMichael. The deadline is also Nov. 20. Learn more here: floridadisaster.org/irrigation #FL02

Our energy is better focused on fixing unemployment, ensuring our schools can open safely, & expanding testing & treatments. The well-being of our nation is more important than baseless election conspiracies & that is what should be prioritized. #DemsAreGoingPostal #FL02
It’s absurd that Congress is wasting taxpayer dollars to come in on a Saturday for the USPS (an entity that is already funded well past November) & not to vote on a relief package for Americans who actually need relief. #FL02 #DemsAreGoingPostal

USPS also routinely moves mailboxes that receive little use. More than 14,000 mailboxes were removed under President Obama. Democrats are using this routine practice to amplify misinformation and add to their baseless conspiracy theory. #FL02
Here are the FACTS - the Postal Service is NOT broke. 
Projections currently show that the US Postal Service currently has enough funding to last thru at least August 2021, long after the presidential election. #FL02

I applaud President Trump & his Administration for taking the initiative to make our nation more independent as we fight the #COVID19 pandemic. For far too long, we’ve relied on suppliers outside of the US & our allies for medical supplies & essential prescription drugs. #FL02
