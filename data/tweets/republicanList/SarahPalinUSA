The Atlantic holds a special place in my heart. 

After years bloodied in the media meat grinder - but still resolutely standing - my thoughts on this week’s “news” to consider, considering the source: pic.twitter.com/tQ5R9RDGQ9
🙈Yep... t’was me behind the #BearMask, I LOVED singing on The Masked Singer stage ~ it truly was a blast (now that it’s over!!) Great to work with the BEST producers & crew, many of whom have been so good to our family over the years. pic.twitter.com/BQkEFmYTaO

America’s heart breaks for Kobe Bryant’s loved ones. God, words alone can’t soften the stunning sadness hitting so many of us but may our prayers for a miraculous touch of comfort reach Kobe’s beautiful family. Lord, please envelop all who loved this superstar 💔 -SP
I offer experience showing a biased, intolerant, sexist medium full of left-wing activists, not rational, credible journalists.

But before agreeing with The Atlantic’s latest claim that our Commander in Chief grossly disrespects our military,...
