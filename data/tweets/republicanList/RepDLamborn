Today's vote was nothing more than a partisan ploy orchestrated by House Democrats weeks before an election. It is clear that the #CCP has acted in bad faith, allowing this virus to spread across the world. We must join @realDonaldTrump and hold China accountable.
Today we will be debating the annual National Defense Authorization Act. This bill fulfills our constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense. It includes a pay raise for our troops, fully funds nuclear modernization, & provides funds for @SpaceForceDoD. pic.twitter.com/zVrs8xrJqd
.@JeffBezos is right. #BigTech should be scrutinized, especially those showing blatant bias. Facebook shouldn‚Äôt censor Conservatives & @Twitter shouldn‚Äôt censor @realDonaldTrump. 

That‚Äôs why I introduced H.Res. 984 condemning the censorship of @POTUS. pic.twitter.com/cvoCc7pbD3
I'm grateful that the @DeptofDefense has taken initial steps to better protect the rights & freedoms of our service members. I will continue working with my colleagues @RepDougCollins & @RepHartzler in protecting these fundamental liberties.

We cannot continue allowing the Palestinian Authority to pay salaries to terrorists or their families. I am calling on @realDonaldTrump to designate Qadri Abu Bakr to be listed as a sponsor of terror for his evil deeds. pic.twitter.com/SKYPummOr6

BREAKINGüö®@POTUS brokers yet another historic agreement normalizing diplomatic relations between Israel & the Muslim-majority nation Bahrain. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for your tireless devotion to peace in the Middle East. Unlike Obama, you truly deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.
Huawei is nothing more than spyware for the #CCP. I am thankful that @BorisJohnson is taking these threats seriously and is banning Huawei from the U.K.'s 5G network. We must combat China's predatory actions and companies. twitter.com/axios/status/1‚Ä¶
First Democrats wanted to defund the police, and now they are trying to eliminate your god-given rights enshrined in the Second Amendment. This attack on the @NRA is the latest step in their far-left agenda.

Thanks to the Obama administration, JCPOA funded the Iranian regime's adventurism throughout the Middle East. I applaud the @realDonaldTrump administration's implementation of #snapback sanctions. This will go a long way to curtail chaos in the ME and around the world. twitter.com/SecPompeo/stat‚Ä¶

Incredibly, Dems just voted against @HouseGOP legislation to provide additional funding for COVID testing, vaccine development, the PPP & law enforcement. Dems have been focusing on a debunked postal service conspiracy theory instead of helping the American people.
