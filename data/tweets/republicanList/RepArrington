We must enforce the laws and regulations preventing federal assistance flowing to America’s largest abortion provider, especially while families struggle to keep food on the table and their businesses afloat.

These dollars must be accounted for.

Earlier this year, Wayland University President, Dr. Bobby Hall, presented me with memento from the Flying Queens induction in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame which is proudly displayed in my D.C. office. pic.twitter.com/rTaYMSLYfd
Today, 16 of my colleagues joined me in writing a letter urging @TheJusticeDept & AG Barr to protect our 2nd amendment rights & to investigate rogue prosecutors who target innocent Americans as part of their antigun, not anticrime, agenda.

There are all sorts of nefarious activities surrounding China and they must be held accountable for the mass devastation they’ve caused around the world.

Democrat Leadership must take the American people as absolute fools. 

@HouseDemocrats falsely calling into question the security of our elections to justify a 25 billion dollar bail-out is a dishonest, predatory scam and a political pay-off to their government union bosses. pic.twitter.com/vBMdv6g7aj
Last month, I filed legislation to strengthen the accountability for those convicted of rioting & assaulting a federal officer.

Yesterday, I met with the presidents and faculty members of @ACUedu, @HSUTX, & @mcmuniv to discuss covid relief efforts.  

I am proud of them for embracing the risk and leaning into reopening our country. pic.twitter.com/rCSAXQA7RR
For years, we heard the Left say you didn’t need guns because law enforcement will keep you safe.

Now, with violent crime on the rise, they want to defund the police.

TUNE IN: At 1 ET/12 CT, I’ll be joining @TeamCavuto to discuss the ongoing violence across the nation and our economic recovery.

For the sake of our Republic, elected leaders must do everything within our control to promote peace and public confidence regarding the outcome of this election.
West Texas is open for business! 

I enjoyed meeting with business leaders & job creators from the Key City at the @Abilene_Chamber Business Expo.

100 yrs ago, our country made a significant step toward becoming a more perfect union by giving women the right to vote.

Susan B. Anthony paved the way for generations of young ladies like my daughter, Jane.

The American people know this is just the latest attempt from @HouseDemocrats to score political points.

Referring to a virus by its place of origin, as we always have, is suddenly offensive? 

This is about dividing our country and opportunism like I have never seen before. pic.twitter.com/79YWWCWVGr
At the @WhiteHouse on 9/11, it felt like we were under siege. I was sad, shocked & angry.

There will always be countries that want to destroy us b/c they hate our culture, freedom & American ideals.

We can never apologize for it. We believe in it. We fight for it.

God-fearing, freedom-loving West Texans can’t afford to be under-represented in the U. S. Congress.

With COVID relief funding, we have to ensure West Texas families in need can get temporary and targeted assistance in a way that incentivizes fully reopening our economy and returning to normal.

It should be straight forward: As Americans, we should be for peaceful protests, but against violent mobs.

We should be for legal immigration, but against breaking the law & providing sanctuary for criminal aliens.

Local & state leaders won’t lead.

Local DAs won’t prosecute.

Now, we have a VP candidate literally writing blank checks to wreak havoc.

There is no ambiguity in their message.

Socialist Dems aren’t only tolerating, but encouraging these violent riots.

In the same week @SpeakerPelosi called Members of @HouseGOP “enemies of the state,” she’s refused to condemn the violence of Marxist Mobs.

Ann Dorn suffered a loss no American should face.

Earlier this month, I introduced the David Dorn Act of 2020 to double the penalty for federal rioting charges.

When you want a job done right, hire a Texan! Congratulations to @DHS_Wolf!

I introduced 3 anti-rioting bills increasing penalties for violence & assault, and affirming the federal role in restoring order when local leaders won’t.

Enough is enough! We get what we tolerate.
