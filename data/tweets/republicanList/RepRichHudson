It was an honor to host @ENERGY @SecBrouillette at @FtBraggNC this morning for a discussion with Lt. Gen.

While the final regulation published today for the @DeptVetAffairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers is a positive step, it fails to address many of the concerns that my bipartisan Care for the Veteran Caregiver Act corrects.
