Joining @PoppyHarlowCNN on @CNN momentarily to talk @USPS. Tune in!
.@SpeakerPelosi created a bogus @USPS crisis fueled by conspiracy theories.

Without bothering to hold hearings on this supposed crisis, she's rushing a $25B bailout bill to "fix" what doesn't even exist.

This illustrates everything that's wrong with DC & @HouseDemocrats. pic.twitter.com/akOsHyW3rC

Democrats seized on delays in the mail due to #COVID to push wild conspiracy theories that the #USPS is rigging the election.

This bogus political narrative is a ploy to sow confusion in the run-up to the election and throw a @realDonaldTrump victory into doubt. pic.twitter.com/9wzEdYN67i
Buckle in, folks. It's going to be a long morning at @GOPoversight.

@virginiafoxx and PMG DeJoy definitively set the record straight.

But @OversightDems will keep pushing bogus conspiracy theories all day.

70 days from the November election, @HouseDemocrats want to force states to adopt universal mail-in voting â€“ sending out ballots en masse â€“ while simultaneously banning voter ID laws.

This is completely unprecedented and is a recipe for fraud. pic.twitter.com/auIdIZQAAA
This is a *huge* win for all who value peace & prosperity.

@realDonaldTrump has done more to secure world peace than any president since Ronald Reagan.

@POTUS has EARNED a #NobelPeacePrize many times over for blazing a new path in the Middle East. twitter.com/realDonaldTrumâ€¦
Nothing "explosive" here.

We've always known Louis DeJoy was a GOP donor â€” and the *bipartisan* @USPS Board of Governors knew it when they unanimously selected him after a nationwide search.

*Many* Democrat donors were placed in positions across the government under Obama... ðŸ‘€ twitter.com/GerryConnolly/â€¦
The Postal Service has been losing revenue for 13 years.

@OversightDems haven't held a hearing on @USPS since April 2019.

But now @SpeakerPelosi is pushing a bogus political narrative to help her in Nov. so there's suddenly an "emergency."

Donâ€™t believe the Democrats, folks. pic.twitter.com/mjih2ZFxl7
No one has done more for peace on today's world stage than @realDonaldTrump.

Unlike @BarackObama, @POTUS deserves a #NobelPrize. foxnews.com/politics/trumpâ€¦
Incredible law enforcement story in Georgia this week.

This is why we #DEFENDThePolice.

Who will protect the most vulnerable in our society when Democrats #DefundThePolice?

The citizenry of a free country can self-govern themselves only with an authentic understanding of right and wrong.

.@SpeakerPelosi has consistently proven she is unable to lead the House in tackling the real problems facing Americans.

Her toxic leadership is dangerous, and she's got to go. That's why the @freedomcaucus is leading the charge to remove her as Speaker. bit.ly/3kvuE22
Adam Schiff â€” failed Hollywood screenwriter and psychotic Washington conspiracy liar â€” has proven time and again that he absolutely can't be trusted with American values.

Democrats refuse to be honest with themselves and confront the truth. They manipulate plain facts for political gain â€” or so they think.

In reality, America won't stand for the Democrats' failure to rein in its extremist supporters.

Would Democrats allow firearms to be purchased via the mail without identity checks?

Of course not! They'd lose their minds because they know it would lead to massive fraud.

If guns must be purchased in person with proper ID, then voting can and should be done the same way.
"Critical Race Theory" is divisive & harmful to America's culture & values.

It is the intellectual driving force of the radical Left that justifies their attacks on our society.

This toxic ideology has no place in our federal government.

Thank you, @realDonaldTrump @POTUS! twitter.com/realDonaldTrumâ€¦
Democrat mayors care more about appeasing & indulging anarchists than protecting their citizens.

Federal dollars should not be used to subsidize failed local politicians who refuse to restore law & order.
