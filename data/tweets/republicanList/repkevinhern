Great read from @marknilsstrand
on the necessity of the House returning to work.

Chris, give my office a call (202) 225-2211
If a vote is called next week, I will be on the first plane to DC to cast my vote and fulfill my constitutional responsibility to my constituents.
Anti-police rhetoric across the country is dangerous and only encourages more of the violence we saw in Tulsa yesterday. With rioters shouting "kill cops" all over the country, the heartbreaking reality is that this will not be the last act of violence against police.
This violence is absolutely the result of vile, anti-police movements around the country. While police reform is certainly needed, law enforcement is not the enemy. Killing cops will never be the answer.
There are 435 Members of the House elected by the people of our districts to serve for your benefit, not at the whim of career politicians like Pelosi & Hoyer. My responsibility is to my constituents, so I’ll be working in Oklahoma with you until our next vote is called.
Democrats could cancel the district work period and schedule hearings, debate, and votes for next week, but that’s not what they’re doing. Instead, they’re leaving Members of Congress in the dark as to what’s happening, telling us not to make plans.
BREAKING: Tulsa is a finalist for @Tesla's new factory. #TeslainTulsa would be great new jobs and fantastic for our community. @elonmusk, we'd love to welcome you to Tulsa!

Stopped to talk with @NexstarDC to explain my ‘no’ votes on both bills we’re considering today. So much has changed about the way Congress functions; the Capitol is empty & our staff are remote, but it’s nice to have conversations with the press in some semblance of normalcy. pic.twitter.com/aXa8lK0m43
Well, I’m not going to sit on my hands & wait for Democrat leadership to tell me what to do. I am not going to cancel plans to meet with constituents back home in Oklahoma’s First District so that I can sit in my office waiting for as-yet-unknown legislation from Hoyer & Pelosi.
With reports of agitators & rioters traveling across the country to protest @realDonaldTrump's rally this weekend, I want to make one thing clear:
if your goal is to cause harm & devastation to a community you do not belong to, do not come here. You are not welcome in Tulsa.
I will continue to plan meetings and events with constituents back home, and continue to hear your concerns and talk with you about the issues that matter to you.
There’s been so much support for this legislation, I’m looking forward to the chance to earn the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The only way to ensure the safety of our future is to put #AmericaFIRST
We welcome and value peaceful protesters - whether you're here in support of the President or against him.
War & Peace takes the average American 40 hours to read. It's shorter than the 1800-page bill @SpeakerPelosi introduced today.
In addition, I'm glad to have the support of 15 original co-sponsors:
@RepMattGaetz @RossSpano @RepMoBrooks @congbillposey @RepChipRoy @DavidRouzer @DougLaMalfa @RepBrianBabin @RepMullin @RepScottPerry @VickyHartzler @RepTimBurchett @RepGregMurphy @RepDanBishop @RepMikeGarcia
Officer Aurash Zarkeshan has only been an active member of the force for 6 weeks after graduating police academy in May. He has a servant's heart & finally achieved the goal he's been working towards for years. He is stable, but not out of the woods yet. He needs our prayers.
The outpouring of love for the Johnson & Zarkeshan families in Tulsa is truly incredible. Thank you to everyone who has lifted up these families in prayer & shown support for our law enforcement!

Crystal, can you call my office (202) 225-2211? We'll help however we can.
Insane abuses of power from un-elected bureaucrats trying to disrupt our peaceful transfer of power and undermine the Trump presidency before it even began. I’m glad we are finally seeing some justice & accountability, I look forward to more. twitter.com/WSJ/status/129…

Democrat Leader @StenyHoyer just told the entire House that “no one should schedule themselves for next week.” 

What he wants is for House members to do nothing but wait for Speaker Pelosi to decide if we’re going to have a vote on new coronavirus legislation.

Officer Aurash Zarkeshan is on the mend! He's not out of the woods yet, but Aurash began breathing without an intubator today, which is an incredible step forward in his recovery. Keep Aurash in your prayers as he continues to heal.

This act of unspeakable violence is unacceptable. There is no defense for it, and the criminal who shot these officers will be held accountable for his actions.

Sgt. Craig Johnson is a leader among our police force & has served our community for more than 15 years. He is well known in the community for his dedication, attention to detail, and incredible compassion. He remains in critical condition. My prayers are with him & his family.
The fact that Senate Democrats won’t even agree to debate @SenatorTimScott s #JUSTICEAct proves all we need to know (even @SpeakerPelosi has said she'll work with GOP on it). It was never about creating real change, it was always about politicizing an issue to the fullest extent.
