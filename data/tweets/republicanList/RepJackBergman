While the partisan rancor has taken the headlines, the reality is - throughout the Coronavirus crisis, President @realDonaldTrump’s Administration has delivered for Michigan. pic.twitter.com/NuAMUGbULp
Last week, President @realDonaldTrump announced an Executive Order that directs federal agencies to cut regulatory red tape, improve efficiency, and encourage economic growth in the face of the coronavirus. 

We agree Mr. President. It’s time to #TransitionToGreatness. pic.twitter.com/t9UeCbxX80
Due to demand, PPP funding will run out today, but Congress has the ability to act to replenish these funds. 

Yet political games and blind partisanship is blocking this from happening, all at the expense of our small businesses. 

Congress must act NOW! pic.twitter.com/CK2ezt51LA
One of the incredible parts of serving in Congress is having the opportunity to meet so many young men and women who are taking a stand, and growing into our next generation of leaders.

Great way to start the day in Petoskey! pic.twitter.com/xBdYamDvmu
Big news for #Mi01. Thanks @AjitPaiFCC! twitter.com/AjitPaiFCC/sta…
Thank you President @realDonaldTrump for visiting the Northwoods. The hardworking men and women at Fincantieri are the epitome of America’s best, and American made. While the shipyard is located in Wisconsin, thousands of their employees live right here #Mi01!  🇺🇸 twitter.com/realDonaldTrum…
Although I was in DC, our team had the opportunity to welcome @SBAJovita to Traverse City to see firsthand how the #PPP and #EIDL were a lifeline to so many businesses in #Mi01. twitter.com/SBAJovita/stat…
Thank you President @realDonaldTrump for your support for our state throughout this crisis. 

Welcome back to Michigan! twitter.com/WhiteHouse/sta…
Locating this spaceport in the U.P. will create the opportunity for our residents to use their skills, talents and technological expertise to adapt to the changing needs of the commercial and defense space industries.

The America I fought for - and continue to fight for - is better than this.

We are a nation of law and order. We stand against injustice, we value life, we defend our neighbor, and we honor the men and women who protect our communities. 3/
Today, I had the opportunity to speak at our local ceremony and join fellow Veterans here in Watersmeet to honor our nation’s fallen warriors. 

We will never forget. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/9nvIJxmirA
In 2018, @realDonaldTrump promised @RepMoolenaar, @RepPaulMitchell, and I that he would prioritize building a new Soo Lock. 

Today, the @USACEHQ announced that construction equipment has arrived in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan to begin phase one.

Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi introduced a $3 trillion, over 1800 page, socialist wishlist. I’ll be leaving Watersmeet shortly to head to D.C. to oppose this partisan boondoggle.

.@SpeakerPelosi, bring S.785 to a vote ASAP. Our Veterans can’t wait. 

It passed the Senate unanimously and would easily pass the House. I know, because 250+ U.S. Reps cosponsored the same policy in my legislation, the IMPROVE Act, which lies at the heart of this critical bill. twitter.com/GOPLeader/stat…
Steve is right - this dangerous rhetoric by the Speaker is unacceptable. twitter.com/SteveScalise/s…
S. 785, which passed the Senate unanimously, is based on my legislation - the Improve Well-being for Veterans Act. 

I strongly urge @SpeakerPelosi to bring this legislation to a vote on the House floor THIS WEEK and immediately send this critical legislation to @POTUS desk. pic.twitter.com/7VoPXSHIwl
In the face of adversity, Americans always rise to the occasion. We have a long way to go, but this is certainly another step in the right direction.￼￼

Preventing Veteran suicide is one of my highest priorities in Congress, and this is a critical step forward in the legislative process.

I urge @SpeakerPelosi and @RepMarkTakano to do right by our Veterans, pass this bill and get it to @POTUS desk!

The provisions included in S.785 are modeled after the IMPROVE Act, which I have been working to pass in the House. This is one of my highest priorities and I applaud the Senate for passing this Veterans mental health package in a bipartisan manner. twitter.com/HouseVetAffair…

For over a decade, around 20 Veterans have taken their own lives each day. We cannot tolerate this lack of progress because we know that even one suicide is too many.
