China wasted no time silencing free speech in Hong Kong & arresting those, such as Jimmy Lai, that dissent from the communist message of Beijing. As I pointed out in my op-ed last month, there are steps that can be taken to punish China for these actions.

I've worked tirelessly to unite FL Congressional delegation on this issue, pass legislation to permanently extend the moratorium in the EGOM, & lobby this admin on the need to keep offshore drilling from being a potential danger to our economy, ecology, & military readiness2/3

@POTUS is right to push back on China’s hegemonic ambitions & abusive authoritarian practices & to call for reordering Western companies’ supply chains to reduce dependence on China. In the words of Lenin,"The Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them"(1/2)
75 years ago today the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower accepted the unconditional surrender of German forces which ended military conflict in Europe.

Today, @POTUS signed the Great American Outdoors Act into law. This legislation, which I cosponsored, will provide our national parks with badly needed upgrades, tourism development, and wildlife refuges.
It is encouraging to see this issue of Chinese infiltration gaining traction. @SenTedCruz and I sponsored the SHEET Act to address exactly this issue. It is time to pass this legislation in the House and Senate now. mailchi.mp/hfacreps/top-h…
This is truly an unworkable  idea and can only result in more disastrous policy. Defered amounts will either be forgiven or reimbursed by the federal government or worse, employers will be required to pay them. (2/2)

The President’s executive order takes us one step closer in bringing prescription drug costs to a heel. I supported the End Price Gouging for Medications Act with this same goal in mind. Reigning in the pharmaceutical industry is long overdue. google.com/amp/s/www.wash…
Kathleen and I would like to extend our thoughts and prayers for @RepAndyBarr and his family over the unexpected loss of his wife, Carol.
Please join me in celebrating #worldoceansday. As an avid outdoorsman, I am constantly reminded of how blessed we are to enjoy our oceans. We must continue to take significant steps to clean and preserve our oceans so future generations will also be able to share in their beauty
This move will reflect that Poland is a reliable security partner for the United States and will strengthen U.S. military capability to respond to any Russian aggression in the Baltics. (2/2)

Remote voting effectuates social distancing and follows proper health procedures. The work of Congress must continue, but it need not put people at risk unnecessarily. (3/3)
Votes have been occurring remotely for several months now, with no adverse consequences. Given the recent COVID-19 positive test results for my colleagues, including Louie Gohmert today, this method of voting is the prudent and rational course of action. (2/3)
As I have said before, Congress should utilize modern technology to permit remote voting. While I wanted to proxy vote as soon as the Speaker set it up, I agreed to wait until the lawsuit challenging its legality had been heard, which has now happened. (1/3)
I am pleased to report that 5,000 pythons have been removed from the Florida Everglades and surrounding regions by the @SFWMD, @MyFWC, and @NatlParkService. This is a significant milestone in the fight to remove these harmful animals. content.govdelivery.com/accounts/FLSFW…
