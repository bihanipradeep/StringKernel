INBOX 📩 fantastic news from @DeptVetAffairs this morning! VA prescription opioid use down by 64% over the past eight years. Read the full release here: va.gov/opa/pressrel/p… pic.twitter.com/RQBVfe6EIl
It was great to meet the Farmer’s Rail team & learn about their farm-to-table operation.

They were preparing to open a new store in @CityofHudsonOH when #Covid_19 hit but were able to continue w/ their plans thanks to #PPP. Can’t wait to stop by when they’re open! #supportlocal pic.twitter.com/kzaFJKI84r
It was great to stop by Anderson International Corp in Stow this week and see how the #PPP loan they received helped them keep their #smallbiz afloat and keep ALL of their 73 employees on payroll during the #COVID19 pandemic.

Don’t those #MADEinUSA stickers make you proud? 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/d3odNl4SvN
Great to see CARES Act funding continue to lift up #SmallBusiness & workers in Northeast #Ohio who were negatively impacted by #COVID19. This grant program will provide much-needed support to 43 local businesses. A must-read in @thestarbeacon ⬇️ starbeacon.com/news/coronavir…
We have the responsibility to #supportourtroops and ensure they have access to the assistance and mental health care they need.

Endorsed by @afspnational and @ohiospf, our bipartisan bill will help our nation fulfill that responsibility. Learn more here: joyce.house.gov/press-releases…
National #SuicidePrevention Month begins today. You can help others by raising awareness, breaking down the stigma surrounding #mentalhealth and sharing resources. 

If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, call 1-800-273-8255 or text 'NAMI' to 741741. pic.twitter.com/7HjeU9Lw5I
The #GreatAmericanOutdoorsAct has been SIGNED INTO LAW!

I was proud to support this bipartisan bill that will provide full funding for the Land & Water Conservation Fund & address the maintenance backlog at our national parks, including the 8 @NatlParkService sites in #Ohio. pic.twitter.com/ex5gEowDf7
Always happy to have this guy by my side whether I’m working here in Ohio or in back our nation’s capital.

Failing to reach a deal on how to address the ongoing health & economic crises caused by #COVID19 is unacceptable - a failure of duty to the American people.

That’s why I joined @RepGolden & 16 other Rs & Ds in urging @SpeakerPelosi @GOPLeader to immediately resume negotiations. pic.twitter.com/J5RHiEdoSQ
🚒🚨 GREAT NEWS FOR NEOH 🚨🚒

@fema has awarded 13 #OH14 fire depts $2+ MILLION in Assistance to Firefighter Grants. This funding will ensure the brave men and women who risk their lives to keep us safe are protected and properly equipped on the job ⬇️ bit.ly/3fG1fPW
As we grapple with #COVID19, the #opioidcrisis continues to devastate communities across the country, including in #OH14. Fatal drug overdoses hit a record high last year, accounting for the deaths of 70,980 Americans...36,500 of which involved synthetic opioids like fentanyl. pic.twitter.com/EhU5ekIb37
Wishing everyone a safe and Happy #4thofJuly!

There’s never been another country like ours, where the rights and freedoms we enjoy give us the opportunity each and every day to create a more perfect union.

God bless America 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/U2tUeOgw8w
Our law enforcement officers are often the first on the scene when someone is suffering a #mentalhealth crisis. But without adequate training, those encounters can be dangerous and tragic for all parties involved. That's why I cosponsored @RepKendraHorn @RepAGonzalez's H.R. 2698.
Today, we celebrate the generations of American workers who helped build this great nation and those whose hard work continues to help our communities get back on their feet and reignite our recovery from the ongoing pandemic.

Wishing everyone a safe and happy #LaborDay 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/2Tp3OhSHWR
On her last day, I want to thank Elizabeth for her hard work this summer. Her #internship was a bit unconventional bc of #COVID19 but she made the best of it. Please join me in wishing her well as she begins her senior yr in college!

Please join me in praying for all the families who live each and every day with the memory of their lost loved ones. May God bless them and may God continue to bless the United States of America. #NeverForget
This week, I was humbled to recognize the life and service of @USMC Sgt. Wolfgang K. Weninger on the House floor. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who joined me in a moment of silence to honor him & pray for his loved ones in the wake of their loss. RIP 🙏🏼🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/rFIeUCyFQv
I saw Michael’s mom on @WEWS the other night speaking out about her son’s death, bringing awareness to the lack of attention focused on the #opioidcrisis right now, the limited resources available to combat addiction during the pandemic & the continued rise of synthetic opioids.
The Law Enforcement Training for Mental Health Crisis Response Act of 2019 will help save lives by:

▪️improving coordination b/t police & mental health workers
▪️giving police depts the $ needed to train officers on how to best respond to those suffering a #mentalhealth crisis
Today, we celebrate the generations of American workers who helped build this great nation and those whose hard work continues to help our communities get back on their feet and reignite our recovery from the ongoing pandemic.

Proud to join all those who turned out tonight in the @CityofChardon square to support @PoliceChardon.

Encouraging news heading into Labor Day wknd. This #JobsReport marks the 4th straight month of plummeting unemployment since the pandemic began.

While the CARES Act provided $300 million to aid #fisheries impacted by the #COVID19 pandemic, the law has been interpreted in a way that doesn’t allow the #GreatLakes region to qualify for that assistance.
Did you know that #LakeErie is the walleye capital of the WORLD and supports one the the biggest freshwater commercial #fisheries in the WORLD?

Each year, more than $300 MILLION is spent in the #Ohio Lake Erie basin on fishing alone 🎣
I look forward to seeing these tax dollars returned to NEOH.

This @USDOT $ will help airports in Summit & @CuyahogaCounty complete critical infrastructure projects, ensuring the communities that rely on them for transportation can continue to do so safely cleveland.com/open/2020/09/c…
The CARES Act is a product of bipartisanship in Congress - something we need more of right now. The stakes are too high for the partisan bickering to continue.

It's past time for negotiations on the next #COVID__19 relief package to restart.

In 2018 alone, 541 servicemembers died by suicide. That is 541 too many.

A true American hero. RIP 🙏🏻 twitter.com/OhioVets/statu…
GREAT NEWS from @HHSGov! In total, 49 Ohio health care centers received a total of $4.6 million, including #OH14’s @SigHealthInc which received $261,020. I’m proud to support funding for our critical healthcare providers in NEOH.
