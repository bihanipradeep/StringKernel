@GovInslee shows us once again the dangers of failing to understand the science and the critical role every American plays in stopping invasive species and protecting our farms. nypost.com/2020/09/17/jay…
Today’s report from @ClimateCrisis misses the mark in many ways, in particular the lack of provisions to provide domestically sourced materials to make the energy of the future possible. #CriticalMinerals iea.org/articles/clean…
Thank you @EPAAWheeler! twitter.com/EPAAWheeler/st…
We can talk about offshore wind, projects that were repeatedly delayed because the NEPA science was completely inadequate, now delayed by COVID. They will inevitably be delayed in the future by lawsuits again, because of NEPA. 7/

It is politics and posturing. Building things in America is hard, look at SunZia, a renewable energy only transmission project, started in 2006 aiming for completion in 2024.  One transmission line, renewable energy only, 18 years. 4/

It’s becoming clearer by the day that excessive government regulations have been a catalyst for the fires we are seeing across the West. Sadly for the town of Berry Creek, CA it has had a destructive effect. krcrtv.com/news/local/fir…
The future of our energy security and national infrastructure depends on the reform and modernization of NEPA. Today’s announcement by @realDonaldTrump is a great step forward! westerncaucus.house.gov/news/documents…
Thank you @EPAAWheeler! Having a thriving energy industry and a clean environment is not mutually exclusive. twitter.com/EPAAWheeler/st…

Thread on energy from Western Caucus Executive Director @TimChartersn5 twitter.com/TimChartersn5/…
Then we have the problem of nimbyism. Right now, carbon free hydropower is facing a citizen referendum this fall over transmission. Energy transmission directly designed to displace fossil fuels facing voters whims in blue states. 5/

Instead of being concerned about foreign affairs, @GovInslee should learn the science and protect citizens of his state from real threats. agr.wa.gov/applemaggot
Making energy is hard, reforming NEPA is the key, and the Western Caucus has been working on an active renewable energy and traditional energy agenda for decades, if our “unity” colleagues want to build things, join with us reforming NEPA and we can make it happen.
Today is a great day for Alaskan communities and American manufacturing. The Trump Administration is leading the way in putting American’s to work and developing our critical mineral resources. doi.gov/pressreleases/…
Today’s action by @SecBernhardt is a giant step towards American energy independence! Responsible energy development in ANWR will create thousands of jobs and fuel our country! westerncaucus.house.gov/news/documents…
Thank you to @EPAAWheeler for keeping this Administration’s promise to put transparency at the forefront of regulatory decision making!  westerncaucus.house.gov/news/documents…
Prohibiting the safe extraction of energy resources on public lands is not only bad for our energy security, but will also cause economic harm and cripple state governments. This policy is bad for Rural America and the country as a whole. twitter.com/APIenergy/stat…

Allowing the process to work and following the science is the correct path to follow.

Providing regulatory certainty under the ESA is critical for small businesses, property owners, and every day citizens. Today’s announcement by @USFWS and NMFS is a great step forward in providing that certainty! @SecBernhardt @USFWSDirector @SecretaryRoss westerncaucus.house.gov/news/documents…

Relying on China to meet our mineral needs is no long sustainable! westerncaucus.house.gov/news/documents…
The current pandemic has shown us many things, first among them is we cannot continue to rely on other countries to meet our own needs. We are pleased that the Senate has included @lisamurkowski’s bill to address critical mineral supply chains.
