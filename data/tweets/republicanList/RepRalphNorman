Since a fever is one of the most common symptoms of #COVID19, then perhaps #TSA checkpoints could serve, in some limited capacity, to help reduce spread through #airtravel.

Just introduced: the #HealthySkiesAct with @RepTedBudd.

In cities across the nation, mobs are tearing down or defacing America‚Äôs monuments with impunity.

This is not how civilized, rational people advocate for change. These are criminal acts that must be stopped.

Senate Dem's didn't torpedo the JUSTICE Act because of what's in it. They just couldn't tolerate or allow @SenatorTimScott, a Republican, receiving the credit.

You'd be hard pressed to find even one elected Democrat willing to stand up lately for our #police. Or publicly oppose the recent violence around our nation.

In light of recently unsealed testimony from Planned Parenthood execs, I've asked A.G. Barr for an update on the DOJ investigation into their alleged monetization of human fetal tissue. (1/2)

While #PortlandRiots put that city under a HELLISH siege, there's an effort underway in Congress to actually tie the President's hand on the use of federal law enforcement.  These are NOT peaceful protesters! pic.twitter.com/HBba8wmCVX

From @netflix execs all the way to the parents who allowed their children to be part of this ‚Äì there were actually ADULTS in the room who somehow thought this was appropriate.  This is truly gross.

Last week, I introduced a bill to help #Congress and health officials better understand the degree to which #TSA checkpoints could serve, in some limited capacity, as a way to help mitigate the spread of #COVID and future pandemics.

Is attending church during a pandemic more dangerous than attending a protest?

Apparently so in our nation's capital.

Common sense to most of us. Sadly for others, an opportunity to manufacture a crisis.

If you rely on the #USPS to handle your election-related mail, then you have a responsibility plan accordingly. That means 2-5 days in transit, each way. Minimum.

Different take on today's #SCOTUS ruling: it wasn't about about birth control.

Instead, it was a clear reminder that government has a VERY high threshold to cross before infringing upon religious liberties. Just as it should have.
