There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation and confusion right now about the U.S. Postal Service, its finances, and its ability to deliver mail ahead of the upcoming election. Here are some of the facts. ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/YQ9umo4wel
Another $500B to state & local governments does little to re-open businesses or create jobs.  It is just another bailout - plain and simple.
 
@SpeakerPelosi is putting a bailout for progressive politicians ahead of real #COVID19 relief.

‚ÄúDestroying‚Äù?  Ahh - the false crisis now rises to urban legend status.
This report by @ncri_io is deeply concerning as it shows there are extreme online communities actively fomenting violence & anarchy in a well organized manner. We cannot allow extremist groups seeking only chaos to gain a foothold in this country.

Well - apparently the manufactured ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù of the USPS is not getting reinforced by the pharmacy sector.  I have now met with a couple of area postmasters. Both agree - there is no operational crisis! pic.twitter.com/lI1foqb6xQ
The #19thAmendment was ratified 100 years ago today, formally enshrining women‚Äôs right to vote after a long fight by suffragists across the country. Today we recognize and celebrate this occasion and the critical role women have in our democracy. pic.twitter.com/GdARR46ZnL
**** I thought I had posted the share link.   Sorry all.  I will repost with proper link. Good article.
It's disappointing that instead of working on much needed #COVID19 relief, @SpeakerPelosi called an ‚Äòemergency‚Äô session for a supposed crisis at the #USPS. The facts are clear ‚Äì there is no emergency, Democrats have chosen to spread misinformation for political gain. Read More:

The House just passed and I voted yes on the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.
 
This legislation requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations in the workplace for limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.
It's #WomensEqualityDay, which commemorates the adoption of the #19thAmendment to the Constitution. On the 100th anniversary, let us recognize the trailblazers who paved the way for this achievement & appreciate the progress made in our country toward securing equality for all. pic.twitter.com/BFXQOVp125
