Last night I introduced legislation calling for an end to the outdated ‚ÄúOne China Policy‚Äù and closer ties with our allies in #Taiwan.

We have few legislative days, but House Dems would rather waste time on partisan attacks and relive impeachment than discuss the real issues. pic.twitter.com/FkYXbPphL4
Today, @RepMcCarthy discussed the riots, lawlessness and mob violence in Madison.

The criminal behavior needs to stop. 

Enough is enough. pic.twitter.com/kCNaRFEsh3
I visited the new border fence with @RepAndyBiggsAZ in Cochise County, AZ that keeps illegal trafficking out of the country and protects the property of local ranchers. 

Truly a success story. pic.twitter.com/YKSPlF9Loo
These violent riots are no ‚Äúmyth‚Äù. twitter.com/JudiciaryGOP/s‚Ä¶
Once again, the message from liberal politicians is ‚Äòdo as we say, not as we do.'

Defunding the police is a fringe idea that is both dangerous and extreme.

Americans want safe communities, not lawlessness and anarchy.
Open-ended school shutdowns have set students back and pushed parents to the breaking point.

Today, with @RepPeteStauber, I introduced legislation to permanently remove the gray wolf from the federal endangered species list. We need to return the authority to control the gray wolf population back to where it belongs: the hands of state lawmakers and wildlife officials.
