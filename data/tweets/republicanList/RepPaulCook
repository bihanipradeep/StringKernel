Welcome back.
The House just passed S. 47, the Natural Resources Management Act. It now goes to the President for his signature. When it becomes law, it'll be the most comprehensive public lands bill to pass Congress in over a decade. bit.ly/2BUocOh pic.twitter.com/HXB8ubyGad

Thank you @SBCOUNTYFIRE for stopping by my office. Your service to our community is indispensable and it was an honor meeting with you today pic.twitter.com/twW52ASaCT
(2/2) I’m proud to support this cost-effective legislation that will ensure resources are directed to where they are needed. We must be proactive in preventing the spread of Coronavirus. pic.twitter.com/vu5XZHhEny
Much of the American West has experienced horrific wildfires this year. That’s why I cosponsored HR 7978 to protect our communities from the threat of wildfires. I’m hopeful Congress will act quickly to pass this bill so the President can sign it into law. bit.ly/2ZKoHWQ
I strongly support a bipartisan extension of the #payrollsupportprogram for our aviation workers. It will save jobs and help the economy. Let’s get this done now.
Veterans are not a line item in a budget. They are human beings and, in this case, the bravest and most honorable among us. The Barstow Veterans Home represents our commitment to those who have served our country.

(1/2) I just voted for the bipartisan Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which passed the House overwhelmingly. This bill provides free testing for those who need it and financial assistance for those hard-working Americans who are impacted by the virus.
(3/3) The government of Iran is the number one sponsor of terrorism worldwide, and we must proceed cautiously while remaining resolute in protecting our country and in defending freedom.
(2/3) Soleimani ran Iran's terrorist Quds Force for over a decade and has orchestrated countless terror attacks, including the attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week.
(1/3) The Pentagon reports that the U.S. military has killed General Qassem Soleimani, a brutal terrorist responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members and killing thousands of civilians in Iraq, Syria, and across the Middle East.
I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year! As we gather with loved ones and reflect on our blessings, let’s also remember our service members serving both at home and overseas protecting our nation. I hope your holiday season is warm, peaceful, and safe. pic.twitter.com/UlMp2XBfvr
Each year, we have this special day to remember all that we are grateful for as we spend time with our loved ones. Let’s also take a moment to be thankful for those serving in the military who can’t be with their families today. Wishing everyone a happy and safe Thanksgiving! pic.twitter.com/t86Qy117Rx
I'm proud to stand with our ally, Israel, and support Israel's right to defend itself against these attacks from Islamic Jihad.
I commend our brave US military forces for the successful raid in northwest Syria on Saturday which killed the world’s most wanted terrorist, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. We must continue to be vigilant in our efforts to fight terrorism and defend our national security.
For two decades, Kurds have fought on frontlines alongside US troops against terror. We should remain in a position to prevent unnecessary conflict between two of our traditional allies. Abandoning the Kurds could lead to devastating loss of life and the potential return of ISIS.

Whether deriding racial minorities at home or cavorting with Nazis and white supremacists abroad, Rep. Steve King brings dishonor to himself, the party of Abraham Lincoln, and his nation.
