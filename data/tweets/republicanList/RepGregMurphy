Yes. You are a troll.
Unfortunately NCâ€™s Governor, not Trump, is the one whose administration took 3 months to develop a nursing home testing program. #factsarepainful

That's fine. Feel free to travel to those areas and get mugged. Let's see who you call for help and who doesn't answer. If this is the kind of society you want, go for it.
Chinese infiltration of American academic institutions has become far too pervasive. That's why I introduced legislation to crack down on it.
