I don’t want to ever go back to this awful way of thinking across the US government. This poor take by then Secretary of State John Kerry aged so badly.

Our amazing police officers all throughout our country need our support now more than ever. 🙏 They are under attack. We need to back our heroic men and women in blue like never before. twitter.com/LASDHQ/status/…
This Biden family dirty money scheme should be criminal if it’s not already. What they were up to in China, Ukraine and elsewhere was disgusting. twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr…
RIP United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 🙏

Another historic deal in the Middle East delivered by @realdonaldtrump! This agreement between Israel and Bahrain represents continued progress in this peace mission, which has been elusive for far too long.
Monumentally historic progress unfolding before our eyes today. Excited to be here @WhiteHouse right now for the signing of the Abraham Accords.🇺🇸🇮🇱🇦🇪🇧🇭Anything & everything is possible...peace, stability & prosperity. This is amazing leadership. Excited about what’s still ahead!
Pres Trump, Jared Kushner, Mike Pompeo, David Friedman, Avi Berkowitz, etc leading Team USA working on peace in the Middle East, strengthening Israel, defeating the ISIS caliphate & standing up to Iran’s aggression are absolutely crushing it. So proud of these great Americans! 🇺🇸
🚨New video from today’s @HouseForeign charade where Dems tripled down on their irresponsible, reckless, hyper partisan attempts to take down @realDonaldTrump & @SecPompeo. For a moment...even just for a moment, they should try uniting our country rather than breaking it in half. pic.twitter.com/5j7dk4JYJZ
“The government acknowledges that there were material omissions, and the Court has found violations of the government's duty of candor, in all four (Carter Page FISA warrant) applications.”

Leading from a position of strength not weakness, @realDonaldTrump has reversed decades of flawed Middle East policy. This trend towards peace & stability in the Middle East is critical to the security of the US & world. Read my new op-ed in @FDRLST: thefederalist.com/2020/09/17/tru…
The Middle East has been forever changed for the better. An honor to be here ⁦@WhiteHouse⁩ for this beautiful pivot towards peace, stability, partnership, and prosperity.

Through generations, larger than life Americans have risked it all on the battlefield to defend our freedoms. Many were captured & others never returned home. We should remember & honor all of these heroes today, on National POW MIA Recognition Day, & everyday. pic.twitter.com/bbKe0GQeOB
“The government admits that at least the third and fourth (Carter) Page applications lacked adequate factual support.”

233 yrs ago, our #Constitution was adopted & signed. This document has withstood the test of time, establishing the unshakable framework of the greatest nation on earth, while enshrining the principles of freedom & liberty that have become synonymous with the American way of life pic.twitter.com/YefCK2jFhW
Coming on the heels of the historic deal recently announced between Israel and the UAE, this shift towards peace, prosperity and security in the Middle East is a direct result of US leadership and fortitude.
America is worth fighting for. 

America is worth dying for.

We must #NeverForget the lives lost, emotions felt, heroism witnessed of 1st responders, justice delivered overseas in response & health toll paid since by those amazing 1st responders who spent days & weeks at Ground Zero. We must Never Forget September 11, 2001. pic.twitter.com/zqtZ6SXkLF
