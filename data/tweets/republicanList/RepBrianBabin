House D’s won't pass needed #COVID19 relief, but they'll jump to make us vote on a meaningless messaging bill condemning the words "Wuhan Virus" - don’t forget D’s used these exact words in one of their official committee hearings. Hypocrisy at its finest! bit.ly/3iHvisL

A 16-year-old girl was murdered because of Democrat sanctuary city policies. I’ll say it again - bad DEMOCRAT policies protected criminal MS-13 affiliates and allowed for another to be killed. They are responsible and must be held accountable. foxnews.com/us/baltimore-m…
This is a necessary step to finding who was behind the Russia hoax. Millions of your hard-earned tax dollars were WASTED funding a bogus investigation. American taxpayers deserve to see justice come to those who broke our laws to assault @realDonaldTrump. foxnews.com/politics/senat…
Attempts to smuggle illegal aliens into the country occur daily. Thankfully, @ICEgov, @CBP & #HSI agents work around the clock to stop this & shut down every stash houses they discover. kfoxtv.com/news/immigrati…
If you think the radical Left hasn’t infiltrated our schools - you’re wrong. These despicable teachings should be condemned across the board - no matter your party affiliation. NY seems to have forgotten the NYPD officers who sacrificed everything on 9/11. fxn.ws/2ZAQXuS
Ironically, @SpeakerPelosi claims to be dedicated to giving #COVID19 relief to Americans - but she’s the very person responsible for Congress’s inability to do just that. So far she’s been unwilling to negotiate a deal that doesn’t push her radical agenda. rollcall.com/2020/09/15/hou…
Wanting to protect children from being exploited and sexualized for profit has nothing to do with conspiracies. It’s our duty to safeguard their innocence. Why’s the Left trying so hard to sweep this under the rug? nationalreview.com/2020/09/critic…
Praying for the safety of our coastal neighbors as Hurricane Sally makes landfall soon. As hurricane season continues, we must all stay informed on developments in the Gulf and as prepared as possible for any future storms. foxnews.com/us/hurricane-s…
The election schedule shouldn't impact when Durham's findings are made public. Americans deserve to know, in a timely manner, about any criminal actions that took place in past investigations. I led my colleagues in pushing for this – read more below. bit.ly/2FpHcsy
Freedom-loving America will not tolerate the forced labor conditions enforced by Communist China any longer. Proud of the @WhiteHouse and @StateDept for this decision. state.gov/cbps-continued…
After courageously battling cancer for many years, sadly, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away yesterday. She had long years of service on the Court, and we pray for her family and loved ones. fxn.ws/35QMOHu
Only since @realDonaldTrump took office has stabilizing the Middle East been deemed a “distraction.” How dare @SpeakerPelosi even mention those with #COVID19 when she REFUSES to pass legislation giving them additional relief. breitbart.com/clips/2020/09/…
#OperationWarpSpeed is working to deliver a safe and reliable #COVID19 vaccine to the American people in record time. No shortcuts are being taken.

If Mueller expects Americans to believe he & his team “accidentally” wiped their government phones - he’s lost his mind. Our eyes are open & we see what happened.

Netflix’s “Cuties” clearly meets the U.S. legal definition of child pornography. It’s disturbing to see a mainstream media company promoting the sexualization of children - it shouldn’t be allowed. I‘m requesting AG Barr bring charges against @netflix for distributing this film. pic.twitter.com/DQW1Kc2Jxu

This is exactly why Section 230 has to go. Big Tech repeatedly shows blatant bias across their liberal platforms. Conservative groups are banned, yet Antifa – a terrorist organization – is allowed to have a page? There must be accountability. foxnews.com/media/facebook…
The Putin regime sentenced Texas native & former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed to 9 years in a Russian prison on baseless charges. That’s why we are calling on Putin to #FreeTrevorReed and send him home to his family.
