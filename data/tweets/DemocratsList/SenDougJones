My statement on the passing of Justice Ginsburg: pic.twitter.com/5Qfu3DrQJ1
People are suffering & we need to pass a bill that provides renter relief, renews emergency unemployment benefits, helps schools/hospitals/USPS, helps local governments + more. 

Americans deserve a better bill. They deserve better than cynical political stunts. pic.twitter.com/IiEvVEevoJ
montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/202… This morning, #HurricaneSally made landfall in Gulf Shores. As the storm moves further, inland there is potential for life-threatening storm surge, heavy rainfall, flooding & forceful winds. Please visit ema.alabama.gov for assistance & stay safe.
After enduring COVID & #HurricaneSally, many of Alabama's Main Street businesses need more help to recover and rebuild. My new bill with @SenJohnKennedy will allow disaster-hit businesses to receive CARES Act loan forgiveness. Read more: jones.senate.gov/newsroom/press…
57 years ago, four innocent little girls were killed by a bomb planted outside the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. Today, we can honor the memories of Addie Mae, Carol, Cynthia & Denise by uniting against the forces stoking the flames of hatred & division. pic.twitter.com/sH1QfjeFMI

South Alabama is facing significant rainfall with #HurricaneSally that will cause dangerous, widespread flooding. If you're in the region, please ensure you & your family have an emergency plan in place & stay tuned to your local news for updates. twitter.com/mynbc15/status…
Folks, we can’t let up now. The mask mandate is working, but we each have to do our part. Remember to social distance, stay home as much as possible and to #MaskUpAL! pic.twitter.com/VzxOiB4tRf
McConnell’s decision to send the Senate home for a month without a COVID relief deal is an unconscionable failure of leadership and an insult to the sacrifices that so many Americans have made to get this virus under control. 

My full statement here:

South Alabama is under a state of emergency as #HurricaneSally approaches landfall. With this storm comes the potential for high winds, historic flooding & tornados. Please be sure to stay up to date & have an emergency plan in place.  al.com/hurricane/2020…
Black women make 62 cents to every dollar paid to their white male counterparts—a major injustice, but part of a bigger problem.
