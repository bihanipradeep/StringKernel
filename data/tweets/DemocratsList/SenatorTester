Today marks a dark day in our history—the nation has surpassed 200,000 deaths from COVID-19, including more than 150 of our fellow Montanans. More than just numbers, these people were our friends, neighbors, and loved ones. Sharla and I grieve for their families.
For more than two hundred years, the U.S. Military Academy has taught and trained leaders of character, including some of America’s best and brightest. 

Prospective students should join MT's virtual Academy Days tonight at 6pm MST.

Today's tragic milestone is a reminder that we must do all we can to prevent further spread of this virus. Simple steps like wearing masks, social distancing and practicing good hygiene help us protect each other. Together, we can overcome this crisis. But it will take all of us.
Congratulations to Montana's 2021 Teacher of the Year, Kristi Borge! Mrs. Borge can do it all—she teaches all grade levels and subjects in a one-room schoolhouse in Polaris while still finding time to support students in and out of the classroom. #MTProud

Postmaster Louis DeJoy continues to leave Montanans waiting for answers as to why mail collection boxes were removed across our state. I won't stand for this complete lack of transparency from @USPS—DeJoy must be held accountable. twitter.com/MaritsaNBCMT/s…
Tonight this country mourns an icon. Justice Ginsburg was a trailblazer who devoted her entire life to equal justice. May her memory be a blessing.
This decision is more than just a win for our nation's election integrity—it's a win for the folks in rural America that have seen their prescriptions, Social Security benefits, and more delayed due to DeJoy's politically-motivated policy changes at @USPS.

Today's Senate hearing on the Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Act outlined the facts — this Montana-made land management proposal:

✅ Creates jobs
✅ Preserves thousands of acres of public lands
✅ Strengthens MT's outdoor economy

Now let's get this one over the finish line. pic.twitter.com/uJqoaaJAM7
This public health crisis has outlined the need for telehealth services that serve all our VA beneficiaries—especially those without access to reliable broadband.

Some pharmaceutical manufacturers are threatening to undermine low-income patients’ access to prescription drugs.

Good news in Great Falls! $10 million has been awarded to build a new aquatic-recreation center as a part of the Defense Community Infrastructure Program. This project is the result of a lot of folks’ hard work—I'm proud to have written the bill that made this program possible.
Postmaster DeJoy's explanations for why mail collection boxes were removed across Montana don’t add up. ICYMI, I'm keeping the pressure up and pushing @USPS for the answers folks in the Treasure State deserve. pic.twitter.com/0tsl2JCZ4Z
Looking forward to Wednesday's hearing on the Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Act. My colleagues will have the chance to understand just how critical this made-in-Montana bill is in helping create jobs and protecting our public lands. pic.twitter.com/YceTeL0fBV
This morning’s orange sun rise over the hazy and smokey unseen Bear Paw mountains.  My heart aches for the families who have lost their homes. I pray everyday for them and the awesome firefighters.

Looking forward to today's Senate hearing on the made-in-Montana Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Act. 

3 out of 4 Montanans support this commonsense approach to land management—my colleagues in the Senate should follow their lead and vote this bill out of committee.
It's clear that DeJoy intentionally delayed mail delivery of Montanan's essentials to try and help his political cronies. This decision means folks can rest a little easier knowing a return to regular mail delivery is on its way.
The American people must have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. My full statement below: pic.twitter.com/i3zLFJOTWD
