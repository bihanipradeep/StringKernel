“My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed."

This was Justice Ginsburg’s final wish. President Trump and Senate Republicans must honor it.

We must also stand up against President Trump's attacks on immigrants and communities of color and acknowledge the heavy toll that the pandemic has taken on so many Hispanic families. I’ll continue to fight for issues that matter to NM's diverse Hispanic and Latino communities.
The census has a serious impact on our lives. New Mexico needs an accurate 2020 Census count because the federal funding at stake supports the programs we need, like Medicaid, education, road improvements, school lunches, and more. santafenewmexican.com/news/local_new…
Here’s a script to get you started:
“Hey there, did you fill out the 2020 Census? I took mine at 2020census.gov. We only have until September 30th, so can you send this to family and friends to make sure they get counted too?”
That just doesn't cut it. Despite what their members are saying, many trade organizations that spend millions of dollars on federal advocacy remain silent on the climate crisis. #TradeUp
I will commit to holding the Majority Leader and all Senate Republicans accountable to their own standard. Anything less would be hypocrisy at its worst and a grave injustice to the American people.

I'm filled with gratitude for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's extraordinary life that inspired America. She served on our nation’s highest court with conviction and intellect, inspiring generations of women and young girls to stand firm in their fight for equality.
Have you responded to the 2020 Census yet? You have just over two weeks to #GetCounted before the census deadline on September 30th. Your response will help New Mexico get critical federal funding. Head to 2020census.gov to get started.
Two bills @SenatorTomUdall and I introduced to designate portions of the Gila River as Wild and Scenic and establish Cerro de la Olla Wilderness within the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument received a key hearing today. Watch my opening remarks here ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/9wEbI82mRB
The THRIVE Agenda provides a visionary framework for economic recovery and climate action, while simultaneously taking on the generational, systemic challenges of racial injustice and economic inequality. theverge.com/2020/9/10/2143…
The Trump administration is willing to ignore laws and abuse its executive power on a regular basis, but when it comes to giving elementary schoolers access to our National Parks, they're going to hold the line.

Justice Ginsburg was a champion for women—and all Americans—and an icon whose legacy will endure. 

It is absolutely critical that we honor the final wishes of Justice Ginsburg and fill her seat only after the next president is inaugurated.
New Mexico needs a complete and accurate census count, and you can help us get there by encouraging others to fill out the #2020Census. 

Start a texting tree by texting five of your family and friends, and have each of them text five others!
My colleagues and I have been calling out trade organizations for the role they can play in blocking climate action.
 
It's a start to see corporations enacting more climate-forward policies internally. But then they send trade orgs to lobby against meaningful action. #TradeUp

With just weeks before the presidential election, we must let the American people decide when they cast their ballots in November. 

In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has set a precedent for this very situation.
