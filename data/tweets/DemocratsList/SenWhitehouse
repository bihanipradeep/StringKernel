In the shadow of history, Republicans face a choice, & the Republican leader’s behavior signals the stakes. Minutes after learning of Justice Ginsburg’s death, Mitch began bending Republican senators to his quest to stack the Court with justices amenable to his right-wing donors.
Federal law requires disclosure of outside interests advising the President. So, what role did anonymously funded right-wing groups play in building Trump’s Supreme Court list?
For one night, let us just focus on the career of this remarkable woman; her courage, her grace, her tenacity, her dignity, and her contribution to the law. Ruth Bader Ginsburg represented the best in our country.

BRT’s members need to get a handle on their trade groups. Just last week @TechNetUpdate came to Congress with thirteen pages of legislative priorities that didn’t mention climate change or carbon price.
Your tax dollars at work.

Great to spot the problem of judges “auditioning” for advancement, but why overlook the question — auditioning to whom?              nytimes.com/2020/09/16/opi…
Yeah, right. That would be consistent with the balance he’s shown.

Read Captured Courts report; follow the money.   
democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-rep…
Fact of the matter is I’m calling out a huge dark-money-funded scheme to capture the Court, and the schemers (polluters in many cases) resent my attention to their mischief. Follow the money; count the partisan 5-4 decisions; tally the damage.  
democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-rep…
This is a step forward for corporate America. None other than the WSJ called this announcement a “sea change.” Another ‘sea change’ will be when BRT’s member companies show up in Congress to support climate action.

Nobody who understood sacrifice or selflessness would call veterans “losers.” We need to stand up against this behavior, and remember those who enabled it. pic.twitter.com/TQx2hTLUv0
Today, the @BizRoundtable, representing scores of America’s leading companies that together employ 15 million people and generate $7 trillion in revenues, said climate action was important and endorsed a carbon price. This is great news.

Great work by @FERC @FERChatterjee @RichGlickFERC. States like RI have shown the potential of distributed generation to reduce emissions & deliver cheaper power. That’s why @MartinHeinrich, @SenMarkey & I pushed hard to get this over the finish line.

Many BRT members are also members of @USChamber, one of America's worst climate obstructors. For real progress, members should tell the Chamber: support science-based climate policy like the BRT or we quit.

If Trump and Mitch McConnell are serious about lowering drug costs, there are bills in McConnell’s #LegislativeGraveyard that would provide immediate relief to seniors.
We must take this moment to reflect on America, and to honor her values: Show your face. Keep your word. Protect our institutions. Respect our voices. Love your country first. This is a moment of destiny. An anxious country awaits our choices.
