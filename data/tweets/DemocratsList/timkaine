I will oppose the filling of the Supreme Court vacancy until after Inauguration Day. Will GOP Senators honor their word or rush a nominee and undermine both the legislative and judicial branches?
I just voted early for @JoeBiden, @KamalaHarris, and Democrats all the way down the ticket here in Virginia—what a great day! I hope you'll join me—it's easy, convenient, and boy does it feel good to vote for competence, character, and compassion: IWillVote.com pic.twitter.com/tTS4ysyDUj
Today's the day, Virginia! 

You can vote early in person at your local registrar's office starting today. Look up where to go, then grab your ID and go cast your ballot: iwillvote.com/VA
Mr. President—it’s no Nobel Prize but you can get this Order of Lenin military award on EBay for $2.47. ebay.com/itm/Order-of-L…
I know exactly when and where I'm voting—I hope you'll join me and make a plan to get it done! Check your registration, update it if you need to, and map out your voting plan today: iwillvote.com/VA
Quite simply, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a giant.
 
My condolences go out to the Ginsburg family, the Court, and the over 300 million Americans who benefit from the more perfect union she brought about. pic.twitter.com/nCqAzRnhKE
Early voting in person begins *this Friday* in Virginia! I've been counting down the days and I can't wait to cast my ballot for @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. I hope you'll join me in voting early—we can be among the first to move our country forward. Here's what you need to know:
Joe and Kamala can't restore the soul of our nation alone. We've all got to step up and do our parts. Early voting is an easy way to do just that. Visit @vaELECT's website to find out where you should go to vote early. Let's do this! vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformati…
And hey—if you'd rather vote by mail, you can do that (without any special excuse!). Register online to vote by mail, then when your ballot arrives, fill it out and send it back quickly. (You can even track its progress online!) vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformati…
On this day in 1793, Virginian George Washington laid the cornerstone for the US Capitol. Early voting starts today in Virginia and I will proudly vote for the Biden/Harris ticket, Mark Warner, and Donald McEachin to build a new foundation for prosperity for all Americans!
Too true to be funny or too funny to be true? politico.com/news/2020/09/1…
Virginia is less than a week away from the start of voting!
 
There are so many ways to vote in VA this year—by mail, in person, early or on Election Day—but you know the expression, "the early bird gets the worm"? This year I'm amending that to say: The early vote gets the win.
If you’re going to use the Bible in a photo op, you ought to take a look inside sometime: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” (Matthew 22:39) twitter.com/arappeport/sta…
Congress must investigate these deeply disturbing reports of human rights violations at an ICE facility—we as a nation have an obligation to find out what happened to these women and girls. vice.com/en_us/article/…
Early voting is easy and convenient—you don't need to have a special reason to do it. Make sure you’re registered to vote, then just show up at your local registrar's office with an ID, like a driver's license, passport, or current utility bill with your name and address on it.
Wishing all who are celebrating Rosh Hashanah a happy and healthy new year, especially during these uncertain times. Shana Tova!
We say health care workers are our heroes—we ought to treat them that way. Today I'm standing with Dr. Lorna Breen and all physicians. We've got to do more to support mental health resources for our healers. twitter.com/drbreenheroes/…
Today I'm thinking of those whose lives were taken too soon on 9/11—many here in Virginia—the countless first responders and everyday folks who stepped in to help, and the men and women who have served our country in all that followed. They are heroes. We must never forget.
TOMORROW: Early voting in person begins throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia, and I'll tell you what—I can't wait. Let's show up strong for Joe, Kamala, and all of our great Democrats running to help move the country forward. Look up where to go: vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformati…
The first 4 COVID relief bills were bipartisan—and here is a solid bipartisan proposal from 50 House members that would help families, the unemployed, state and local governments, schools, and small businesses. Senate GOP should allow the full Senate to take up this proposal. twitter.com/repspanberger/…

One great thing about voting early in person when it begins on Friday is that we'll still have more than 3 weeks before the voter registration deadline on October 13—so if you go to vote and find your registration needs an update, you can get that fixed with time to spare.
