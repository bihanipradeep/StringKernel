#tbt to #OpeningDay 1997 — my throw for the Baltimore Orioles generated a @nytimes photo of me with the caption, “Now pitching for the United States.”

I am honored to join @SusanaMalcorra and an outstanding group of women leaders in calling for the UN Security Council to act on #COVIDー19 — as it did on HIV/AIDS and Ebola. We cannot defeat this virus without international leadership and cooperation. bit.ly/3aX3dty
For some reason, my friends who’ve read this interview are now referring to me as Madeleine Exotic #HellandOtherDestinations interviewmagazine.com/culture/madele…
I’m excited to join @HillaryClinton & @MelanneVerveer tomorrow, Sept 10 at 11am EDT to commemorate a watershed moment for women’s rights. Join us: bit.ly/2YiDzuR #Beijing25Roadmap @giwps
Our veterans and military families deserve a leader whose word can be trusted, whose ideals lift people up and whose actions bring people together. 

I am honored to be speaking to the @DNCVetsMilFams at 5 PM ET tmrw.

I stand with Maria Ressa.

With the world relying even more on the Internet during the pandemic, it is essential that we safeguard digital technologies and ensure that all people can access and benefit from them. I applaud @antonioguterres and his Roadmap for #DigitalCooperation un.org/digital-roadmap
As we commemorate the Srebrenica genocide, we must tell the story of what happened, hold the perpetrators accountable, and oppose any effort to deny the suffering of victims. That is the only way for truth and justice to prevail. #Srebrenica25
I know it seems like we are in Hell, but hopefully my new book can transport you to other destinations — if only for an hour or two each day.

#HellandOtherDestinations is out today in print, ebook, and audiobook

With Presidential elections this Sunday in Poland, I am concerned about renewed attacks against the country's few remaining independent media outlets. Thankfully, @USAmbPoland is standing up and reminding the Polish government that strong democracies depend on independent media. twitter.com/USAmbPoland/st…
The images of the #BeirutBlast are horrific. My thoughts are with all of those who have been  affected. The United States and its allies must offer support and assistance to the people of Lebanon at this hour of need.
Today marks the 75th anniversary of the end of WWII in Europe. It is a moment to reflect and give thanks to the heroes who defeated fascism and liberated the continent of my birth. #VEDay75
Social distancing doesn’t mean we have to be anti-social. I was honored to join @AmbDMitchell in leading a call with more than 400 dedicated @NDI team members still working hard across the globe. Their efforts to help democracies deliver are needed now more than ever. pic.twitter.com/Sz6Hoe7IAI
Shocked but not surprised. There should be no room at the highest echelons of US diplomacy for this kind of jingoism. America’s fate is inseparable from that of the world, and we need leaders who understand that. twitter.com/IgnatiusPost/s…
American global leadership depends on the strength of democracy. @staceyabrams makes the case for renewing both in the years ahead.

100 years after the ratification of the 19th amendment, those in power are putting up new obstacles to prevent us from voting. 

But women will not be deterred — this fall, we will turn out and make possible a new birth of freedom and justice for our country.

British PM Neville Chamberlain in 1938 called the conflict between Nazi Germany and my native Czechoslovakia a "quarrel in a far away country, between people of whom we know nothing.” 

Less than two years later, the Nazis were bombing London. twitter.com/paulmcleary/st…
Ruth Bader Ginsburg devoted her life to the powerful premise that every person counts. 

She was a warrior for justice, equality, and democracy. 

Thanks to her, those who carry on these fights will have not only history, but also the law, on their side. 

Rest in peace, RBG

Today I join the entire #Hoya community in honoring the legacy of Coach John Thompson. 

I will never forget the excitement that coursed through campus during that 1984 championship season. He was an incredible leader and an inspiration to so many, including me. @GeorgetownHoops
Last night @joebiden summoned all Americans on a new mission — not simply to take back the White House, but also to take back our country. 

The next 74 days are the most important of our lifetime. Organize and vote. Democracy is not a spectator sport. Iwillvote.com

.@kamalaharris is a proven fighter for justice, an outspoken defender of democracy, and the embodiment of the American dream. She is the perfect partner for @JoeBiden as he works to make that dream accessible to all. I’m all in for #BidenHarris2020 #MadamVicePresident
In uniform and at the highest levels of government, Brent Scowcroft served the country he loved with dedication and distinction. He was a brilliant thinker, a model national security advisor, and a treasured friend. I will miss him dearly. nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/…
On August 7, 1998 — a day forever seared into my heart — terrorists attacked our U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

22 years later, we remember the friends and colleagues we lost and honor all those who put themselves at risk to defend American interests and ideals.
By weakening the independence of U.S. international broadcasters such as Voice of America, the Trump administration is giving yet another gift to authoritarians around the world.

This week the world lost another giant in the global movement towards justice. John Hume was a fearless voice for peace and a great friend of @NDI. He showed the power of democracy to bring citizens together and will be missed by all who cherish liberty. ndi.org/publications/s…
The images of the #BeirutBlast are horrific. My thoughts are with all of those who have been  affected. The United States and its allies must offer support and assistance to the people of Lebanon at this hour of need.
With Congress set to consider another emergency funding measure for COVID-19, Steve Hadley and I make the case for investing in international health, democracy and development initiatives that can help us achieve a lasting victory over the virus.  usatoday.com/story/opinion/…

John Lewis was an American icon who inspired people all over the world to believe in the possibility of progress and the power of protest. 

May he continue to guide us as we strive to be worthy of his legacy.

I was proud to work with @wendyrsherman on the history-making Mondale-Ferraro campaign. This November, we will have another opportunity to make history — but only if women “persist, register and vote.”  thehill.com/opinion/campai…

We came together as a Community of Democracies because we believed in freedom but recognized its fragility.

Today, democracy faces a new round of tests. And it is more important than ever for democratic nations to help one another and work together in solidarity.
