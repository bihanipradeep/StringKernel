This is quite simply one of the most appalling and inhuman statements ever uttered by an American President. twitter.com/amerindependen…
Reminder: Trump is suing to strike down the Affordable Care Act.

If he is successful it would end protections for people with preexisting conditions, drive up health costs, and end health coverage for millions.

The case will be heard by the Supreme Court two months from now.
March, 2018!

- It won’t be ready in “two weeks” or any number of weeks
- @PressSec is lying
- Trump is lying
- Trump is suing to end your protections for preexisting conditions twitter.com/atrupar/status…
Mitch McConnell’s hypocrisy is boundless. 

He does not care about institutions or conventions or principles. He only cares about power — that’s all.

Whatever we do in the days to come, we must not underestimate Mitch McConnell’s cynicism.

Donald Trump was warned repeatedly by scientists, medical experts, and intelligence officials of the deadly danger of COVID-19.

Instead of sharing these facts with the country or using them to craft a strategy to keep people safe, he lied to us.

200,000 Americans have now died.

In televised comments yesterday Donald Trump called for extrajudicial murder and later expressed his desire to remain in office past term limits imposed by the Constitution.

Today members of the party that supposedly backs “limited government” pretend not to know what he said. twitter.com/atrupar/status…

New unemployment claims have held steady since government aid ran dry at the end of July.

The problem: they’ve held steady at a level of weekly job losses dwarfing the worst of the Great Recession.

26 weeks in a row now with more jobless claims than any of the Great Recession. twitter.com/byHeatherLong/…
A new, credible allegation that Donald Trump sexually assaulted a woman at the U.S. Open in 1997.

This is a big part of why the White House refuses to negotiate another aid package: they cannot empathize with people who are not wealthy investors. To Trump the stock market is everything.

This is also one reason Trump keeps lying (“I like playing it down”) about the pandemic.” twitter.com/MichaelSLinden…

More details needed, but key facts here:
