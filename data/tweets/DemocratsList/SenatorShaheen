A new report shows how drug companies prevent competition, push their profits higher, and leave patients with billions in higher costs. Another reminder why we need Republican leadership to allow the Senate to act to lower prescription costs: affordableprescriptiondrugs.org/resources/the-…
.@madeleine is right: peace in Afghanistan should not come at the cost of the freedom & safety of half its population. Women engaged in peace negotiations will help ensure their voices are heard & rights protected. I’ll keep fighting to make this a U.S. foreign policy priority. twitter.com/madeleine/stat…
During COVID-19, NH communities have relied more on the vital work firefighters perform daily as first responders. Glad to announce this funding that will allow Hudson & Bedford FDs to hire new firefighters & boost their ability to serve their communities. shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/nh-…
.@HHSgov is spending $250M for a public relations campaign to “defeat despair & inspire hope.” You read that right. All while the admin has been slow to distribute funds that Congress explicitly provided for testing, PPE and infection control. This is not an acceptable response: pic.twitter.com/j2PON6Owiw
Military firefighters are occupationally more exposed to harmful chemicals, like PFAS. We need to take every precaution to keep them safe, which is why I fought to secure this testing in the defense bill that became law last year. news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-an…
NH schools need all the help they can get to protect students & teachers. I fought to secure this CARES Act $ that helps districts like @mansd_nh obtain PPE & make safety upgrades to minimize COVID spread & will keep fighting for resources for our schools. unionleader.com/news/health/co…
Reports of abuse and neglect at an ICE detention facility - including allegations of hysterectomies being performed on immigrant women without their consent - are horrifying. There must be a full and thorough investigation!

For many Granite Staters, keeping a roof over their heads has been a tremendous challenge over the course of this pandemic. This funding will help those most vulnerable in our society access the affordable housing they need to stay safe and secure. unionleader.com/news/homes/sta…
This is an unacceptable answer. NH’s nursing homes need support NOW to protect residents and the Trump administration is withholding most of the resources Congress has provided. The public deserves answers! pic.twitter.com/qyb3FaEB90
34% of NH high schoolers have reported vaping– an alarming figure, especially amid reports that vaping & smoking increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. That's why I've introduced a bill to hold e-cig companies accountable for targeting kids & will keep pushing the admin to act. twitter.com/laconiadailysu…
Having obstructed bipartisanship for months, @senatemajldr tried to jam a COVID response bill through the Senate that was woefully inadequate & ignored the challenges NH faces. Time is running out– the Senate must pass meaningful relief legislation & should not recess until then. pic.twitter.com/G3yvzaR8eT
Keeping those who tested positive in my thoughts and hoping for a full recovery. My office is in contact with Shipyard officials and will continue to monitor the situation. Every measure must be taken to ensure the safety of our Shipyard workers and their families. twitter.com/WMUR9/status/1…
From the beginning of our nation’s history, Granite Staters have selflessly answered the call of duty to protect our country and tragically, some never return home. We have a solemn obligation to always honor the memory of Staff Sergeant Ouellette and hold his family close.
Pleased to announce $2M in DOJ funding for @UofNH studies that will bolster law enforcement efforts against child sex trafficking, ensure survivors receive the care they need & fight cyber abuse, which is a serious & growing problem among young people. shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/nh-…
Combating sexual violence requires training & education to prevent violence before it occurs & to empower peers to step in if they suspect someone is unsafe. These funds will make investments in @SoteriaSol to develop programs to enhance school safety. shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/sha…

The admin’s political attacks to undermine the census count would have lasting effects in our country. We cannot allow these attacks to continue & skew our results. I joined @SenBrianSchatz on a new call to @uscensusbureau to make sure they get this right: pic.twitter.com/FQyWZpfOXO
It’s with great sadness that I learned of the passing of AF Staff Sergeant Ronald Ouellette of Merrimack. I join all Granite Staters in paying tribute to him & offering condolences & support to his family. Our nation and state are eternally grateful for his service and sacrifice.
