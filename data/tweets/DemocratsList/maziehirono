I think we can all agree #2020 has been quite a year. pic.twitter.com/fV7fknyh13
As an island state, Hawaii can’t drive or easily fly to the next state. We depend on deliveries of our medication or supplies from the @USPS—it's a literal lifeline.

That's why we’re demanding Louis DeJoy reverse his previous changes and stop all future harm. #SaveTheUSPS pic.twitter.com/7n5fZ6lb9t
The truest thing that @realDonaldTrump has said about this pandemic is that he doesn't take responsibility at all.

In fact, it’s one of the few things he’s lived up to - to the detriment of millions who are now suffering because he’s failed at his job. pic.twitter.com/12eJ3O5QXs
The officers who shot Jacob Blake weren’t wearing body cams. If a neighbor hadn't captured video, we wouldn't even know what happened.

The #JusticeinPolicing Act would require police to use more body cameras.

Let's be clear, Russia is trying to interfere with the 2020 election right now.

Democrat or Republican, Obama or Trump Administration, we should all share the same objective - protecting the integrity of our elections.

I agree with Sally Yates, do you? pic.twitter.com/4yiq3ZpNf6
Today as we said goodbye to our much beloved John Lewis, @realDonaldTrump was busy attacking what John fought for - voting rights.

Amidst a pandemic, whether you're a Democrat, Republican, Independent - we should be able to vote safely. One of the safest ways? Voting by mail. pic.twitter.com/YVYAXcTZNr
It was a fun surprise to be included @WSJ, but I do have a slight correction.

While I represent the great state of Hawaii, Hawaiian refers to our indigenous Native Hawaiian community. Everyone else is a Hawaii resident.

I think the @APStylebook would agree with me here. pic.twitter.com/6LmpwaI9KA
I heard from dozens of you about the delays in receiving medication, paychecks, ballots - all because @realDonaldTrump is scared of the election.

He comes right out and says it - he isn't funding the @USPS because of mail in ballots.

We have to fight back. And we will together. pic.twitter.com/3WsvDvSulq
Fund the @USPS. Pass it on. twitter.com/MarkWarner/sta…
Donald Trump and his newest cronie Postmaster General Louis DeJoy are deliberately delaying your mail to undermine your confidence in @USPS.

I want to hear your stories on how @realDonaldTrump's latest attempt to destroy our democracy is affecting you. Let me know below. pic.twitter.com/pNyze9cYCO
The people doing the essential work aren't the Fortune 500 CEO or investment banker.

It's the custodian, child care worker, or bus driver who have ALWAYS been essential - it isn't enough to simply tell them “thank you” and call them heroes.

Actions speak louder than words. pic.twitter.com/zlRcGuiqjO
Today Louis DeJoy confirmed our fears: more big changes to @USPS delivery, especially in Hawaii, are still secretly on the table.
 
Americans rely on the certainty of mail delivery—that won't change after November.
 
Keep fighting. Keep the pressure on. #DontMessWithUSPS
30 to 40 million Americans may lose their homes.
 
Starting today, landlords are free to evict families that were protected by the CARES Act.
 
So what are you waiting for Mitch? #DoYourJob. The Senate needs to #GetBacktoWork and provide #RentReliefNow. sen.gov/QJZ9
Immigrants are disproportionately working in essential jobs to keep Americans safe – often at great risk to their own lives. But many of them haven't received a $1200 check.

@PattyMurray and I are urging Mitch McConnell to ensure everyone has equal access to coronavirus relief. pic.twitter.com/wLFH43eN1w
Your speaking up and fighting back forced this change. But make no mistake: Louis DeJoy's announcement does absolutely nothing to repair the damage he's already done to @USPS.

We can't trust him to do what he says. We need to demand actions and accountability. Don't let up. twitter.com/NPR/status/129…
Rather than encouraging Republicans to negotiate in good faith, @realDonaldTrump is indulging his savior complex with ill-conceived, probably illegal ideas -- including a massive raid on Social Security. Step aside so negotiations can produce a result that actually helps people. twitter.com/washingtonpost…
Jacob Blake shouldn’t be fighting for his life today in the ICU.

This weekend, police shot him seven times in the back as his children watched from the car.
 
It's not enough to just say #BlackLivesMatter, the country must confront the systemic racism head on.
Today marks 100 years since the United States ratified the #19thAmendment  making voting a right regardless of sex.

But it took much longer for women of color to be allowed to vote - barriers we still face a century later.

The fight for equality isn’t over. We march on. twitter.com/amhistorymuseu…
Sec. Bernhardt bragged that @realDonaldTrump's leadership opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the oil and gas industry.

But just this morning the President said "We may or may not do it." So who's in charge? The President or industry?

I wish there was a difference. twitter.com/Yamiche/status…
I have a very simple message for Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell tonight. The best and only way to honor the life’s work of Justice Ginsburg, a giant of a jurist, is to honor her fervent final wish that she not be replaced until a new president is installed.
Trump is only in it for himself.
 
We are approaching 200,000 Americans dead from COVID-19. And yet he wanted to "play it down" to prevent “panic.”
 
What shibai!
 
@realDonaldTrump’s entire presidency is centered on spreading panic and irrational fear. twitter.com/Yamiche/status…
How many more Americans have to die?
How many more Americans have to lose their jobs?
How many more businesses have to close?
How many more children will go hungry?
 
How much more pain do we have to endure before Republicans get serious and act? sen.gov/L2ZK
AG Barr: if you want to defend @realDonaldTrump's lies, he should pay you--after you resign as Attorney General.
Our small family farmers in Hawaii are hurting — just as I’m sure farmers across the nation are hurting.

But while they struggle, Republicans have made sure there's plenty of money for Big Ag.

They just don't seem to care for everyday Americans. sen.gov/VML5
Unions built the middle class in this country. They're the reason millions have weekends, paid time off, and other benefits. This #LaborDay, join me in thanking the millions of union workers on the front lines keeping us safe, fed, and healthy during the pandemic.
Color me not impressed. nytimes.com/2020/09/03/tec…
Donald Trump only cares about himself and money. Service and sacrifice mean nothing to him. 

By denigrating and disrespecting those who serve in the military and made the ultimate sacrifice, he shows himself to be the real Loser-in-Chief. twitter.com/JeffreyGoldber…
The pandemic has shed light on what families and children all across the nation have been facing for years—food insecurity.

It doesn't have to be this way. Congress can and should be doing something, yet Republicans have decided they simply don't care. sen.gov/27ZQ

It’s bad enough that @realDonaldTrump breaks the law all the time. Now he wants his supporters to join him. Voting twice is punishable by up to 5 years in jail and/or a $10k fine. Trump wants his supporters to become felons for him.
It's hard to imagine that in 2020 not everyone has easy access to Wi-Fi.

But like for those two little girls, it's the reality for millions across the country.

@SenateDems are working on a solution - the Emergency Broadband Connections Act would help close the digital divide. twitter.com/CNN/status/130…
It’s been a month since the $600 unemployment program expired. Millions of Americans have had their weekly checks slashed by more than half.

Our national unemployment rate is still above 10% and Republicans don’t care enough to fix it.
There's no good reason for USDA not to extend free school meals until the end of the school year.

While this announcement will come as good news for school districts, we can and should be doing everything we possibly can to feed students.

Our children and families deserve more. twitter.com/USDA/status/13…
Only in DonaldWorld could someone think a photo-op with new citizens can cover up years of this administration's racist, anti-immigrant policies.

As a proud naturalized US citizen, I find @realDonaldTrump's exploitation of these new citizens for political purposes disgraceful. twitter.com/jacobsoboroff/…
Voting now is just as important as it was 100 years ago. As we mark Women’s Equality Day, we cannot forget the fight it took for the right to vote.

We all have a part to play in making the country more equal for women, especially WOC.

Speak out, get engaged, stay involved. twitter.com/TIME/status/12…
Some very good news for 2020. Proof that #VaccinesWork.
 
Thanks to organizations like @Rotary and @USAIDAfrica, the movement to #EndPolio across the world is closer than ever. twitter.com/BBCBreaking/st…
No amount of mansplaining from Peter Navarro to @mitchellreports can justify @realDonaldTrump's continued push for unverified, snake oil treatments.

Navarro/Trump would try to convince us that bloodletting could cure COVID if they saw a potential political benefit.
