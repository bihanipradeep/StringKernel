Ruthie was my friend and I will miss her terribly. The t-shirts simply labeled “RBG” made her notorious. But it was her wit, her tenaciousness, and her skill as a jurist that made her an icon.
With voting already underway for the 2020 elections, Ruthie’s “most fervent wish” was for her replacement not to be named “until a new president is installed.” We must honor her wish.
The POW/MIA Flag's relocation from atop the White House appears inconsistent with the law and is hurtful to veterans and servicemembers – especially POWs, those who did not return home, and their families. The White House should reconsider this decision. reuters.com/article/us-usa…
I’m deeply disappointed by the 9th Circuit decision to end TPS for over 300,000 immigrants. These families are part of the fabric of our communities & economy. Many have been our essential workers during this pandemic. Ending protections for them now is just plain cruel. twitter.com/nprpolitics/st…
Major grocery chains don’t want to pay workers hazard pay during a pandemic — but they’ve got plenty of money for stock buybacks that help CEOs and shareholders get rich. This is disgusting. cnn.com/2020/09/11/bus…
Reports that an @ICEgov detention center is performing mass hysterectomies on immigrants are horrifying. Congress must hold hearings now to investigate these possible human rights violations & the long line of medical abuse & neglect at these facilities. vice.com/en_us/article/…
Ranked-choice voting can ensure that winning candidates have the broadest appeal to the majority of voters. Read my new @GlobeOpinion op-ed with @RepRaskin on how that can help us build a stronger democracy. bostonglobe.com/2020/09/18/opi…
Last year, America’s CEOs at the @BizRoundtable made a big splashy announcement about their commitment to their workers. One year and a pandemic later, it’s clear that was a public relations stunt. in.reuters.com/article/usa-se…
The terrifying pictures from California, Oregon, and Washington make it clear: the #ClimateCrisis is an existential threat to our country and planet. No one state can stop this crisis on its own. The federal government must #ActOnClimate now. nytimes.com/2020/09/10/us/…
Government-backed housing discrimination and environmental racism forced Black families to live near toxic polluters. Now those families are dying from COVID-19. We must fight racial disparities in COVID-19 and dismantle the racism behind this crisis. propublica.org/article/new-re…
As bad as the Lafayette Square attacks on protesters were, they could have been even worse if federal officers got their hands on a weapon that makes you feel like your skin is burning. I still want answers from the @DoD_IG on this ugly propaganda event.  npr.org/2020/09/16/913…
I’m glad that a federal judge is blocking Louis DeJoy’s @USPS changes – but I’ll believe these acts of sabotage have stopped when I see it. Tens of millions of Americans across the country are still counting on Congress to act. #SaveThePostOffice washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020…
Political appointees trying to interfere in the COVID-19 response and suppress public health officials should be removed from their posts. Immediately. politico.com/news/2020/09/1…
Student loan borrowers were in crisis before COVID-19 plunged our economy into chaos. But the President already has the power to help families right now. @SenSchumer & I are introducing a resolution today calling for Executive Action to #CancelStudentDebt.money.yahoo.com/senate-democra…
The Authorization for Use of Military Force became law 19 years ago. Congress gave up its constitutional role to authorize force, which enabled endless wars, humanitarian crises, & indefinite detention. Let's repeal the AUMF & invest more in diplomacy to keep our country safe.
Grocery workers didn’t sign up for a job to put their lives at risk, but they’re doing it every day. No more excuses. The Senate needs to pass a real relief bill that forces giant grocery chains to reinstate hazard pay for workers during this pandemic. #ProtectEssentialWorkers
19 years ago, nearly 3,000 Americans died when terrorists attacked our country. On 9/11, let's unite to remember the victims, survivors, and their families, and recommit to caring for our first responders and their loved ones.
Breonna Taylor was shot to death by police in her own home 6 months ago today. The officers are still walking free. We still #SayHerName and fight for justice for her family and community. nytimes.com/article/breonn…
I’m joining @SenSchumer on Instagram Live to discuss our plan to #CancelStudentDebt. Either Trump and the GOP can act now, or Democrats will act in 2021. Tune in now on Chuck’s account! instagram.com/senschumer/ pic.twitter.com/DBaK68KRfn
COVID-19 has made it impossible to ignore how structural racism creates deep public health disparities in Black and Brown communities. Congress should pass my bill with @RepPressley & @RepBarbaraLee to start attacking structural racism at its roots. washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09…
With voting already underway for the 2020 elections, Ruthie’s “most fervent wish” was for her replacement not to be named “until a new president is installed.” We must honor her wish.
Later, Ruthie’s groundbreaking work as a legal advocate for women led to a distinguished career as a federal judge and a Supreme Court Justice. Her lifelong dedication to fighting for justice for everyone, and her love for our nation, will be sorely missed.
As a young mom heading off to Rutgers law school, I saw so few examples of female lawyers or law professors. But Ruthie blazed the trail. I’m forever grateful for her example — to me, and to millions of young women who saw her as a role model.

Rebuilding our economy so workers & communities can share in prosperity requires real change – not empty promises. I’m urging the @BizRoundtable members to operationalize the principles they claim to hold & reconsider supporting the reforms in my Accountable Capitalism Act.
I asked the @BizRoundtable members from @JPMorgan, @Walmart & other top companies for their tangible plans to implement their newfound values. I also asked them to support my Accountable Capitalism Act to help them give their workers a stronger voice. I heard crickets.

Every time Trump tells the American people not to trust our doctors, scientists, and public health experts, he undermines our country’s pandemic response and puts millions of lives at risk. This reckless behavior of a desperate President needs to stop now. nytimes.com/2020/09/16/us/…
Trump & DeVos have blocked debt cancellation at every chance for public servants, defrauded students, & disabled veterans. Here’s how I see it: if Trump won’t cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt now, Dems are ready to act in 2021. #CancelStudentDebt dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/9/17…
Canceling student loan debt will provide immediate relief to millions struggling during this pandemic. It will increase Black & Latinx families’ wealth & help close the racial wealth gap. And it will deliver a much-needed boost to our economy. #CancelStudentDebt
