Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the first Justice I voted for. Tonight, my heart is breaking for a million reasons—for her family, for our country, for my North Star.

If @SecAzar believes his responsibility is to the American public and not to President Trump, he should demand Michael A. Caputo’s resignation today. twitter.com/nytimes/status…
This year's unprecedented wildfire season has wreaked havoc across WA state. I helped lead the entire WA delegation in urging President Trump to support @GoveInslee's request for additional federal emergency assistance. murray.senate.gov/public/index.c…

This pandemic is far from over. I will keep fighting to hold this Administration accountable, demand science comes before politics, and push the government to act with the urgency this crisis requires. wsj.com/articles/coron…
A reminder for registered WA state voters that you do *not* need to request a ballot. One will be automatically mailed 18 days before Election Day.

When it comes to a COVID-19 vaccine, families across the country must not have any doubt in this process or its final product.

Congress needs to hear from leaders at @US_FDA and @CDCgov as soon as possible about how we make sure this process is free from political interference. pic.twitter.com/5rDeEZqERe
#NationalRecoveryMonth is an important reminder that many Americans continue to struggle with substance use disorders & mental illness, on top of the stress of the pandemic. Share these resources to help those seeking assistance get the support they need.

Last year, over a million people lost health care amid the GOP's continued attacks—& this pandemic is only making things worse. It's long past time Republicans stop their relentless attacks & start working with Democrats on real health care solutions.

CDC's distribution plan is a long overdue step forward but it is not the kind of comprehensive, national vaccine plan that we desperately need from the Trump Admin. We are still missing important details on research, development, manufacturing, & how to address disparities. twitter.com/AP/status/1306…
That fight for justice, which she led so passionately for so long, is now ours to take up in her memory. Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave her all to us, and I will give mine to making sure the American people have their next President before her seat is filled.
It's the students that need our help the most who are facing the biggest burdens in getting financial aid. So instead of forcing them to jump through unnecessary hoops, we need to do everything we can to make their lives easier—and the FAFSA is just the beginning.
We must ensure that college athletes are guaranteed affordable health care and that colleges take responsibility for life-long health issues related to an injury. This is especially critical in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Workers at hospitals, pharmacies, grocery stores, and more continue to make great personal sacrifices every single day to keep us healthy and fed.
 
These workers deserve to be appreciated and taken care of, and that includes providing them with premium pay.
Such an appalling report of neglect and abuse by our government must not go unanswered. @DHSOIG must conduct a swift, thorough review of this report & issue recommendations to ensure this never happens again—which the Department should immediately implement. We cannot allow this.
RT if you agree that essential workers who are working long hours and making great personal sacrifices during the pandemic should receive premium pay.
The gap between how many COVID-19 tests we could be doing & how many we actually are doing, is a clear reminder why the Trump Admin should have created & executed a national, comprehensive testing & tracing plan from the very beginning of this pandemic.

We must come together to take action now, before we lose any more time to save lives and prevent costly mistakes.

We must never forget the brave men and women who didn’t return home or were captured while serving our country. My thoughts are with their family and loved ones—& I will keep working to help ensure all of our servicemembers return to their families. #POWMIARecognitionDay
Commemorating the first International #EqualPayDay is a crucial step to ensure that *all* women—regardless of their sex, skin color, where they live, or what they do—receive equal pay. We must keep fighting to finally close the gender pay gap.
Reminder: even during a pandemic, President Trump and Republicans are fighting in court to take away protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, drive up costs, and more—that's their health care plan.   

We must keep fighting to #ProtectOurCare.
For 73 years, members of the @usairforce have put themselves on the line to protect our nation. I am continually grateful for the sacrifice of the brave servicemembers and their families at @TeamFairchild, @62dAirliftWing, and around the world. #USAF73

President Trump's political meddling in our nation’s COVID-19 response and his dangerous disregard for truth, facts, & science are jeopardizing people's lives & livelihoods.
