Pleased to announce this morning I helped secure a nearly $8m award for @VtTech to create #VT’s 1st advanced manufacturing facility in Randolph Center. leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-an…
No Pres. can undo the law w/ the stroke of his pen. And no Pres. can erase our identity as the humanitarian leader of the world. That's the crux of my bicameral amicus brief today at the DC Circ. to preserve a ruling striking down Pres. Trump's plainly illegal asylum ban: pic.twitter.com/IsvgNN0KwY

There's NO REASON @USCIS should furlough 13K dedicated public servants Aug. 30 in the midst of a pandemic w/ record high unemployment. And ESPECIALLY not when it has sufficient $$ to avoid furloughs through this fiscal yr. Read my letter urging USCIS to delay furloughs HERE: pic.twitter.com/kyHnaPForq

Thank you to all our sponsors and volunteers who help make the Vermont’s Women’s Economic Opportunity Conference (WEOC) such a great tradition. Sadly, we will be cancelling this year’s event due to COVID concerns. Read more here: leahy.senate.gov/press/this-yea… #LeahyWEOC

An American president boasting about covering up the brutal murder and dismemberment of a journalist. Grotesque beyond words. twitter.com/kylegriffin1/s…
Gov. Scott & 7 other govs call for a #2020Census deadline extension. “The Census determines Vermonters’ access to federal funding, and we won’t get another shot until 2030.” Congress must act NOW to ensure a complete and accurate count. @GovPhilScott governor.vermont.gov/press-release/…
Leahy To Lead Senators On Bill To Restore National Guard Coronavirus Funding At 100 Percent @SenSchumer @SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-to…
To protect Africa’s progress and #EndPolio globally, we must maintain U.S. investments in global health and continue to support global partnerships and technical leadership of @CDCgov, @USAID, and @WHO. #EndPolio @Rotary @ShotAtLife
In fact, the Guard that govs DID ask you for Federal help with, in responding to COVID, you CUT payments to, and I have to introduce a law to FIX what you did.

U.S. aid for El Salvador is based on a commitment to shared values, including freedom of the press.  If that commitment is lacking, we have a responsibility to respond.  I joined other Members of Congress in a letter to President Bukele:  leahy.senate.gov/download/hfac-…
It's the last month to respond to the #2020Census. An undercount will have 10 yrs of consequences for affordable housing. At stake in VT: $237 million of annual funding for safe & affordable housing, like Section 8 and CDBG. #YouCount. Go to 2020census.gov today.
The word of a Senator must matter. 

The integrity of the Senate & our courts must matter. 

If Republicans break their word & ram through a nominee in the waning days of the Trump admin, it will be a permanent stain on the Senate & the courts. Read our lttr to Sen Graham HERE: twitter.com/senfeinstein/s…

Under President Trump, everything takes a back seat to his ego and his reelection effort: our nation’s security, our democracy, our health. Everything. twitter.com/dfriedman33/st…
The most fundamental job of the President it to protect Americans from the deadly threats they face – not to deliberately play them down for his or her own political advantage. If this isn’t a dereliction of duty I don’t know what is.
And the Trump administration waited another month, until March 12, to start ordering N95 masks. Incompetence requires a lack of ability or awareness. President Trump’s lack of response was DELIBERATE. And it cost lives. twitter.com/jaketapper/sta…

It was important to me that this facility be located on @VtTech’s Randolph Center campus, ensuring #VT manufacturers around the state will be able to partner and benefit from this important skill training
As a result of this partnership w/business like @GWPlasticsInc, @ConceptsNREC and other #VT employers, @VtTech student’s will have new learning and work experiences that give them the skills to take full advantage of emerging career opportunities
I made including funds for these facilities a top priority in last year’s #Appropriations for the Defense Dept after meeting w/#VT businesses & @VtTech to discuss our state’s workforce needs.
With this federal investment we’re making a strong statement about the importance of investing in @VSC_EDU to strengthen career paths for #VT students and about rising to meet the needs of Vermont’s manufacturers.
