Ban tear gas and rubber bullets.
If we put a 60% tax on the pandemic profits of the richest 0.001% of America, we could cover all out-of-pocket medical expenses for every American for a year.

Portland police routinely attack peaceful protestors with brute force. We must disarm these officers, and every other police department in America, of weapons of war, and enact a nationwide ban on tear gas, rubber and plastic bullets, and bean bag rounds. twitter.com/ACLU/status/13…
Joshua Wong is asking the world to pay close attention to China’s detention & mistreatment of 12 Hong Kongers captured while fleeing to Taiwan. His account of unacceptable intimidation and harassment helps explain why the people of #HongKong fear Beijing’s tightening grip. twitter.com/PostOpinions/s…

$2,000 a month for everyone, retroactive to March.
The world lost a brilliant scientist and advocate with the death this week of Dr. Konrad Steffan, a glaciologist who helped sound the alarm on how climate change was melting Greenland’s ice sheet. pic.twitter.com/AvE6htqGbk
We need $1 trillion in funding for state and local governments so our teachers, nurses, postal workers, and other dedicated public servants are not laid off.
We need at least $4 billion for my E-Rate program to connect every student to the internet and close the homework gap.
Meanwhile, @SecPompeo still resists making a genocide determination, and there’s no explicit mention of the Rohingya in the Trump administration's genocide & atrocities prevention report for 2020. It's time to call crimes against the Rohingya what they are: genocide.
Thousands harmed by Erdogan’s crackdown in Turkey have turned to the European Court of Human Rights, which has pushed them back into the very Turkish legal system Erdogan has undermined. I am urging the court to do more and highlighting strong global support for action. pic.twitter.com/SmqwDNiF2w

Our economy is crumbling. Our communities are falling apart. Our planet is on fire. We can and must rebuild, but any recovery will be incomplete unless we confront the interconnected crises of economic, racial, and environmental injustice.
Our servicemembers have given so much, many of them their lives, to this country. Donald Trump has only taken. He doesn’t know the first thing about sacrifice. I join @SenDuckworth in denouncing his comments that disrespected American servicemembers. twitter.com/SenDuckworth/s…
The Senate Republican COVID package is insulting to the Americans who have been waiting for months for relief. The extent of the misery is unimaginable & McConnell responds by designing a bill so intentionally weak & insufficient that it’s destined to fail.

It’s a game to them.
We must protect all coasts, everywhere, from oil spills and devastation—not just the ones that are politically convenient for President Trump. twitter.com/foe_us/status/…
A trillion in funding for state and local governments so our teachers, nurses, postal workers, and other dedicated public servants are not laid off.
And a nationwide ban on all water and electricity shutoffs. Families are struggling to keep on their power and water on, and we cannot abandon them.
An immediate moratorium on evictions. No one should have to suffer the indignity of being escorted out of their home by the police.

$2,000 a month for everyone, retroactive to March.
This horrific crisis is also an opportunity to deliver some justice to working Americans. That’s why in any next relief package I’ll be fighting for:

$4 billion for my E-Rate program to connect every student to the internet. (THREAD)

Indigenous sovereignty means Indigenous-led solutions for and by Indigenous people. I will keep fighting alongside Indigenous partners to fully codify #FreePriorAndInformedConsent as it relates to tribal consultation.
I’ve led the fight against unfair airline fees. Finally, United is starting to listen. But I won’t stop until every airline eliminates these ridiculous fees and puts people first as we reimagine and rebuild air travel. twitter.com/washingtonpost…
Ban tear gas and rubber bullets.
