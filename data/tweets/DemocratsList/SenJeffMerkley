Since my Republican colleagues have also been adamant that a vacant Supreme Court seat should not be filled in a presidential election year, I look forward to the American people making their voices heard before a replacement is selected.

I'm in contact with the governor's office and leaders in affected communities, and here in D.C. I'm pushing for the federal emergency assistance that Oregon needs to manage and recover from this crisis. Stay safe. (2/2)

The Trump campaign is echoing Russian disinformation. And the Trump admin is helping Russia cover its tracks. The American people deserve to know when their democracy is under attack‚Äîespecially when it comes from within.

We are in an unprecedented moment, with a massive increase in fires all across the state during a global pandemic. My heart breaks for the Oregonians who have experienced so much fear and loss. I'm going to do everything I can to get the resources we need.

We knew that China's abuses against Uyghur Muslims were horrifying, which is why I led the push for sanctions earlier this year. Now, new @BuzzFeed reporting on the scale of China's concentration camps should shock every nation. The U.S. must lead a strong int'l response, NOW. twitter.com/meghara/status‚Ä¶
The Senate will return to DC today. Are we taking up the HEROES Act? Are we going to provide comprehensive relief to Americans who are struggling to get by?

Rent is due again today. Americans need a utility shut-off moratorium and relief from the economic crisis. It‚Äôs time for the Senate to return to DC and take up the HEROES Act. The delays in relief from the Senate GOP are a total abdication of duty. #RentReliefNow
This Labor Day, let‚Äôs take time to honor the essential workers who have kept our communities and country moving through the pandemic. They deserve to be respected and compensated like the heroes they are. #HonorEssentialWorkers
The refusal to provide documents and testimony is a direct assault on our Founder‚Äôs checks and balances to keep the executive operating within the law. This imperial lawlessness cannot be tolerated.

I just want to take a moment and thank all of our wildfire fighters. You're doing an incredible job under dangerous circumstances to save lives. We're all hoping for your safety, praying for you, & appreciating all that you're doing this firefighting season. pic.twitter.com/OKBAFrR81K
Another Trump authoritarian plot to reward friends & punish perceived enemies. The real lawlessness is Trump saying the laws don‚Äôt apply to him, undercutting the checks & balances of our constitution, & undermining the integrity of the November elections.

If this reporting is true, the CBP planned to indiscriminately detain people peacefully protesting for racial justice in Portland. This administration is rotten with handpicked cronies who have no respect for the rights of the American people. twitter.com/dlippman/statu‚Ä¶
Labor Day is a time to honor the movement that has been at the forefront of fighting for the rights of working people‚Äîand benefited us all. But the work continues. Let us use this day to honor workers and continue to fight for them.
The number and scale of fires burning in Oregon is unprecedented, and Oregonians who are suffering need immediate relief. I‚Äôm leading the congressional delegation in pushing for the federal assistance that we need to manage and recover from this crisis. merkley.senate.gov/news/press-rel‚Ä¶
For every American to cast their vote in a safe and accessible way, we need as many poll workers as possible. My plan ensures everyone can serve as a poll worker in the state they live, without being blocked by county lines.

This is a scary, dangerous time for Oregonians. You can remain alert of the crisis as it evolves by signing up for text message, call, or email alerts by texting your zip code to 888777.
With every relief bill, Republicans have said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll address the election in the next bill.‚Äù They‚Äôve done nothing but kick the can down the road. No more delays. The next package MUST ensure that our election is safe, fair and secure.
I just finished touring incident command centers and damage across our state. In 600 miles of driving, I never once got clear of the smoke.

No similar country has experienced what we‚Äôve seen under Donald Trump. It‚Äôs maddening and the outbreak is still not under control even as flu season nears. And here‚Äôs the thing: It was intentionally played down by Trump for political reasons.

Trump's COVID response has been a horrific failure‚Äîand we now know it was an intentional cover-up from the start.
