Health workers need #PPE to protect themselves & prevent spread of infection. With #COVID19 spiking nationwide, we're seeing signs of another #PPEshortage. Trump Admin needs to fully use the #DPA to ensure health workers & patients have needed supplies & protective gear. #PPENow pic.twitter.com/CBEtSiqsgz
The rich, dynamic, distinctive voice is now silent. But the example, legacy, & inspiration of @repjohnlewis lives on. With #reverence & #respect for a true #publicservant & real #AmericanHero: Thank you, John Lewis. Thank you, Lewis Family. pic.twitter.com/B0myNJswr3
Schools need maximum flexibility & contingencies to ensure student health, safety, & well-rounded learning. The Trump Admin should help school gets ready for a successful school year, not condition federal education funding on premature openings. pic.twitter.com/RcnTdjCbKj
Visited @QuonsetRI today to see how two RI commercial dive companies are putting their ingenuity to work saving lives of #COVID patients & keeping front line #healtcareworkers safe. Pleased @US_FDA issued EUAs for Subsalve USA & Lombardi Undersea’s new #OxygenTreatmentHood. pic.twitter.com/HMkZhFmWA0
Pres Trump’s deliberate campaign to weaken @USPS is hurting families, businesses & communities. By delaying the mail to try to disenfranchise voters, Pres Trump is also delaying people’s paychecks, medications, & letters.

The #Census helps ensure RI communities get their fair share of federal funding & representation in Congress. Next 10 days will have a big impact on the next 10 years for our roads, schools & hospitals. Let’s #GetCountedRI! #2020Census Watch live at 10am:

100 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was ratified, guaranteeing American women the right to vote. We are grateful for the courageous women & men who stood up for what was right, fought for progress, strengthened our nation, & changed the world. #SuffrageMonth #WomensVote100 pic.twitter.com/YWZGoigLB0
Two years ago today, Sen. John McCain passed away & America lost a truly patriotic public servant, the U.S. Senate lost a statesman, & I lost a dear friend & colleague. pic.twitter.com/oUKRkcGoJ5
This #LaborDay, we salute America's working men & women whose hard work & dedication built our nation & continue to propel it forward, even amidst a pandemic. We are grateful for those whose activism & organization won hard fought gains that continue to benefit all workers. pic.twitter.com/etLHrsQj4H
On September 11, 2001 at 9:37 a.m., American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, killing 184 people. The #PentagonMemorial is a powerful tribute to those we lost, both on the plane & in the building. We remember the fallen. We will #NeverForget.

Breaking ground today on a new $265M project that will upgrade & improve the busy I-95 Northbound Providence Viaduct. Pleased to work with my colleagues to deliver $60.3 million in federal funding for this project, which will enhance safety & reduce congestion. pic.twitter.com/ObNj0ArXLU
This is absolutely ludicrous, incompetent, and would needlessly put people’s lives at risk.

Pres Trump is taking medical data away from public health professionals at @CDCgov & rerouting it to Trump Admin officials at HHS. This will make it even harder for researchers & health professionals to make accurate decisions & projections.

COVID-19 has transformed how we live, work & grieve. But it hasn’t changed who we are or limited our capacity to care for one another. All of us have reason to hope & remain vigilant. Brighter days lay ahead. But today we pause to reflect on those we’ve lost & honor their lives.
Pleased to deliver $25.3 million to upgrade roads in Cranston, improve connectivity at Quonset, & enhance traffic & safety conditions. New $21.3M #BuildGrant will improve Route 37 & $4M federal grant will study new Quonset connector ramps.

Like states, our cities & towns need help to fight the pandemic. That’s why we pushed for this community block grant money for RI.  $7.6 million in #CDBG is now on its way to help communities combat COVID & support their economic priorities.
pbn.com/r-i-receives-a…
Don't give up, America! We are so much better & more capable than this. #COVID19 is a mindless virus. We can combat it by being smart, considerate, & taking proper precautions. If Pres Trump doesn't want to unify & lead, that's his problem. But the U.S. can & will overcome COVID.
Happy #ConstitutionDay!
Q: What is the very first task of government laid out in our Constitution?
A: The #Census (Article 1, Section 2).
The #2020Census deadline is Sept 30. Please be sure to fill it out & #GetCounted! #Census2020

Both Donald Trump & Vladimir Putin are actively seeking to erode confidence in U.S. elections. Instead of making misleading claims & spreading negative misinformation about our democracy, Trump should work w/ Congress to bolster #electionsecurity.

After months of inaction, the GOP's #COVID bill failed because it was an inadequate, negligent package that would leave millions in the lurch. We need to pass a bill that protects hospitals, nursing homes, frontline workers, & communities hit hardest by the virus...now.

Congressional Republicans took a break from their work responding to #COVID, but the virus didn’t take a pause. Thousands are dying & millions have contracted COVID. Americans deserve more than a partisan show vote -- they need a comprehensive response & overdue assistance.
Hope you have a safe, enjoyable #LaborDay. Today is a great day to support local businesses & honor workers who are on the job by wearing a mask & maintaining a safe social distance.

Our hearts go out to those communities who’ve been hit hard by #HurricaneLaura. Even after the storm passes, difficult days are ahead. The federal gov’t must do its part to supply emergency relief: housing, medical assistance, food, etc. & help states recover.

Your advocacy & action is making a difference: Pres Trump’s Postmaster General Louis DeJoy says he will stop slowing down the mail. Our work is not finished. We must keep the pressure on to #SaveThePostOffice & undo the damage.

Mr. President: If you actually want to help our country, then negotiate in good faith. Democrats put concrete proposals on the table months ago. Your strategy of delay, deny, & dismiss isn’t working (hence your tweet here). Stop making this crisis worse.

Pres Trump said he would “terminate” the mechanism that funds #SocialSecurity. That would be disastrous for seniors & still does nothing to benefit the 30 million+ Americans who’ve lost their jobs during his presidency.

Americans depend on the Post Office to promptly, reliably & securely deliver mail & essential services. I'm alarmed that @USPS nonpartisan mission is now being undermined for political gain. We need a bipartisan commitment to saving #USPS, fixing it & getting it working again.
Good news for RI & @USCG: Two new 360-foot Offshore Patrol Cutters & their crews will soon be based out of @NAVSTANEWPORTRI. These workhorse vessels will be homeported out of RI. Once they are delivered, they will greatly enhance the Coast Guard’s regional capabilities. pic.twitter.com/LqAcb04MwQ
