NEW - My colleagues and I are calling on Ohio Secretary of State LaRose to COMPLY with the COURT RULING directing him to allow multiple drop boxes per county.

OHIOANS: state officials meet Monday to decide whether to pre-pay for the return postage on our absentee ballots.
 
They absolutely should - it's the most straightforward, nonpartisan way to ensure every Ohioan's vote is counted this November.
 
RT if you agree.
When the Trump Administration fined the world's largest pork processor just $10 per infected worker, they sent a clear message to Wall Street:

This President will ALWAYS come down on the side of the wealthy corporations. Workers' health and workers' safety be damned. pic.twitter.com/zcHw2LBnkM
Trump's Fed Board nominee Judy Shelton would be a disaster for workers and our economy.
 
This isn‚Äôt a partisan issue - her economic ideas wouldn‚Äôt give families and businesses the steady hand they need in this crisis. #StopShelton

In the 50 years since Milton Friedman's free market manifesto, corporate profits have soared, worker productivity has increased, and CEO pay has exploded -
 
but workers' wages have barely gone up.

Friedman was wrong then, and he's wrong now. twitter.com/AnandWrites/st‚Ä¶

Thousands of Ohioans in Athens County won‚Äôt be able to watch their hometown hero @JoeyB‚Äôs NFL debut tomorrow with the @Bengals.

NEW GAO REPORT CONFIRMS - when small, Midwestern farms needed help, the Trump Admin overwhelmingly favored wealthy investors with its payments to farmers hurt by tariffs.

We also asked LaRose to use his authority to prepay return postage on ballots. 

Instead, he REFUSED and passed the buck to the Ohio Controlling Board, who then rejected the proposal.

Over 1,200 workers infected & four died from COVID-19 at Smithfield's plant this spring.

The Trump Admin FINALLY fined Smithfield - and how much did they make the world's largest pork processor pay?
¬†
A paltry $13,494 - $10 per infected worker.

The American people deserve a voice in the momentous decision we now face. 

We must wait for their choice to lead us to take office in January to confirm a new justice.
And all of this is happening while President Trump and Postmaster DeJoy are sabotaging our postal system and delaying mail delivery.

Don‚Äôt let ANYONE discourage you from voting. 

Your vote counts, and I‚Äôll keep fighting to ensure all Ohioans can cast their ballots safely.
Our schools desperately need federal funding, and it should NOT be tied to physically returning to the classroom.

Schools should be able to base their decisions on science and public health experts, not President Trump‚Äôs political agenda.
