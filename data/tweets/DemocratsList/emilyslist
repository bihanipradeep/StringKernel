Women belong in the U.S. Senate.
Women belong in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Who do you want to serve a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court?

That’s what’s at stake this year. Vote like it.
The people on Donald Trump’s Supreme Court shortlist are anti-woman, anti-choice extremists. 

We cannot accept their lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court.

We will keep up the fight to elect women to every room and every office where decisions are made. We will make you proud. #ElectWomen
Thank you, Malinda!
Our leaders cannot allow this kind of cruelty. Our leaders cannot sit by while Black & Brown women are sterilized without their consent. 

Our leaders must fight for justice for women in ICE detention.

We must elect those leaders in November. #ElectWomen

What’s happening in ICE detention facilities is not an isolated incident. 

This country has a long history of forced sterilization. It’s a tool of white supremacy that has been weaponized against Black and Brown communities for generations.
