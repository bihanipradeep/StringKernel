I'll do this every day if I have to. There is no excuse for 78 days of presidential silence on #BountyGate.
In Trump‚Äôs twisted mind‚Äî‚Äúif you take the blue states out,‚Äù very few Americans died on 9/11 too.
Plain & simple: Donald Trump has gone 80 days without condemning Putin for putting reported bounties on our troops. 

This is unforgivable.
If you don't think 84 days of presidential silence on #BountyGate is 84 days too long‚Äîyou're wrong.
Our servicemembers could be in harm's way right now because of the reported Russian bounties‚Äîand Trump's 81 days of silence adds insult to injury.
 
The Russia Bounty Response Act would force Trump to act against this malign action from Putin. 
 
@senatemajldr, let us vote on it.
When it comes to Donald Trump's subservient behavior toward Putin, I wonder:

1. Why would he believe Putin over our own intelligence about 2016 election meddling?

2. What does Putin have on him?

3. Why has he not publicly confronted Putin about #BountyGate in the past 83 days?
Everyone living with disabilities deserves equal access to homes that both accommodate their needs & provide a safe environment for them to thrive. 

As a basic starting point, our federal housing programs must reflect that goal.
Just when you thought Senator McConnell‚Äôs #HEALSAct couldn‚Äôt get any worse, the Republican ‚ÄúSkinny‚Äù COVID-19 relief bill removes ALL economic stimulus payments. Americans needs financial assistance NOW.
I'm horrified by the whistleblower complaint from the ICE Irwin County Detention Center. These alleged forced hysterectomies on women are unacceptable, and that's why I'm calling on DHS to conduct an immediate investigation twitter.com/senfeinstein/s‚Ä¶
There are no words to adequately express just how devastated and heartbroken I am to learn of the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Not only did our nation lose a brilliant jurist, we lost a hero. twitter.com/washingtonpost‚Ä¶
Did you hear that?
¬†
No?

Oh, that's because it's the sound of complete & utter silence from Donald Trump on #BountyGate. Day 79.
In the middle of the night, Breonna Taylor was shot to death by police in her own home 6 months ago today.
¬†
To this day, her murderers walk free. That's not equal justice under the law.
¬†
We need #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor. We need the #JusticeInPolicing Act. Now.
With 51 days until the election, our democracy depends on a fully funded Postal Service so no American is forced to risk their health for their vote.‚Ä®¬†‚Ä®But color me shocked, Senate Republicans offered crumbs for @USPS in their new "Skinny" #COVID19 relief bill.
While Senate Republicans are AWOL, Donald Trump is continuing to lie to Americans about the seriousness of the #COVID19 crisis while spewing racism & bigotry to distract us.

Donald Trump‚Äôs silence on #BountyGate for 77 days is a complete dereliction of duty. 

My colleagues and I introduced the Russia Bounty Response Act to require that this Coward in Chief acts to address the threat Russia poses to our nation & to democracy. duckworth.senate.gov/news/press-rel‚Ä¶
Veterans who have sacrificed so much to keep us safe should never have to face unnecessary delays for what may be life-saving medication.

Clearly, Donald Trump doesn't care about the Gold Star families who might be wondering right now if their son or daughter was killed as a result of a Russian bounty program. 
 
Day 82 of presidential silence on #BountyGate.
Different IS beautiful. Way to go, @melissablake!

Tonight we are devastated, but tomorrow we will roll up our sleeves & keep working. We must honor her legacy by redoubling our efforts to safeguard the rights of women, of Americans with disabilities and of all Americans for future generations. We cannot let up now.
Like so, so many other Americans tonight, I am deeply grateful for all she did to ensure equal protection under the law for women across this country & to defend the rights of so many others. She will be sorely missed, but her unparalleled legacy & impact will never be forgotten.
She was a 5‚Äô1‚Äù giant who gave a voice to girls and women everywhere and moved the needle forward in our long fight toward justice and equality for all.
