With nearly ~$20 Billion in backlog, the deferred maintenance needs on the nation‚Äôs #PublicLands are critical. The Great American Outdoors Act will #RestoreOurParks so that we all can safely access & enjoy these national treasures!
Every $1 million invested in #LWCF could support between 17 - 31 jobs. At full funding of $900 million, that‚Äôs approx.  15 - 28 thousand jobs! The #GAOA is not only a vital conservation tool but also an economic stimulus that we desperately need during this crisis!
#LWCF's role in conservation is crucial. Mandatory #LWCF funding keeps our parks, forests & historic sites open & accessible. It also provides important access for hunting and fishing opportunities, and will help grow our local economies & strengthen our communities. #GAOA
