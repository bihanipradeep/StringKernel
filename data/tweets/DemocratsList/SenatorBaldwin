We should be working to expand access to quality, affordable health care right now, but @realdonaldtrump is still trying to take people’s health care away during a pandemic that he knew was deadly 7 months ago. twitter.com/protectourcare…
Today, I’m introducing the bipartisan #GreatLakes Winter Commerce Act with @SenToddYoung and @SenGaryPeters because we must boost our icebreaking capacity to keep our maritime commerce moving and grow our regional economy. twitter.com/UMPressRelease…
Thank you Caron (@realtuffjuice) for all the work you are doing to bring about the real change we need in Wisconsin and I look forward to doing everything I can to advance racial justice and protect the right to vote so everyone’s voice is heard. #NationalBlackVoterDay twitter.com/realtuffjuice/…

I’ve seen firsthand how #CDBG funds help people in La Crosse and throughout our state. Now more than ever, federal funding is needed for our partners on the ground to support our workers, families and neighborhoods. news8000.com/la-crosse-rece…
The U.S. Intelligence Community has confirmed Russia is trying to interfere in the upcoming election through social media.

We need big tech companies to take action now to stop voting-related misinformation and disinformation that attacks our elections and our democracy. pic.twitter.com/0aUKLr6zYi
Following a whistleblower complaint alleging horrific treatment of women and girls, I'm demanding the DHS Inspector General immediately investigate the policies & practices at an ICE facility to protect the rights & safety of women and patients in our nation’s care. pic.twitter.com/pjV8momVBX
This whistleblower complaint filed by a nurse must be investigated by the DHS Inspector General. We need to know what happened to women and girls at this ICE facility. vice.com/en_us/article/…
For months now, I’ve heard from Wisconsinites who aren’t getting the prescription medications on time in the mail. Postmaster DeJoy must reverse the dangerous changes he made so people can get the medications they need. baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases…
Ruth Bader Ginsburg lived an inspiring and historic life, and her work has shaped America for the better. As a woman, I join so many others who will not allow her legacy to be diminished or disrespected.
Remember when @VP Pence said we would be back to normal by Memorial Day?

On Sunday, Wisconsin set a new daily record for #COVID19 cases. 

Trump's failure to confront this deadly pandemic and lead has led to job loss & lost lives. We can’t allow this to be normal. pic.twitter.com/BUw4wMnSZU
The IRS has extended the deadline for Social Security and SSI recipients to enter their child’s information to ensure they receive their $500 Economic Impact Payments. Learn more: ow.ly/un3c50Br8qK
The House passed the #HEROESAct more than 4 months ago, which includes billions in funding for #StateandLocalRelief. We need to get it done in the Senate.
Independent music venues like the @PabstTheater helps #MKE thrive and provides joy and entertainment for so many Milwaukeeans. We must ensure this institution and others in #WI are around for years to come.

Congress must pass the bipartisan #SaveOurStages Act now. pic.twitter.com/30nvR2UmxP
I’ve been working for stronger #MadeInUSA standards to prevent abuse by foreign companies.

There’s more to be done & I won’t stop working until we protect Wisconsin manufacturers & workers. pic.twitter.com/9Rnm2ppvOZ
This is your Wednesday reminder that Trump’s health care plan is to support a lawsuit in federal court to eliminate the Affordable Care Act completely during a pandemic, including protections for people with pre-existing health conditions. twitter.com/samstein/statu…
Inadequate icebreaking in the Great Lakes is costing us thousands of jobs and millions in business revenue. I introduced a bipartisan bill in the Senate to boost our icebreaking capacity and move our maritime economy #Forward. pic.twitter.com/TpR6BTJA2D
Today, Wisconsin set yet another single day record of #COVID19 cases, breaking yesterday’s record.

@realDonaldTrump came to our state and continued to pretend this pandemic will simply disappear. His failure of leadership has made things worse and had deadly results. twitter.com/MSpicuzzaMJS/s…
Many small and independent restaurants are operating at reduced capacity and may be forced to close their doors for good if we don’t act now.

Our bipartisan #RESTAURANTSAct will help folks get through this pandemic and keep our #MadeInWI economy moving forward. pic.twitter.com/SSwHrspS7D
The American people must be able to trust that any #COVID19 vaccine is safe & effective. I joined my colleagues to call on @US_FDA to commit to a fully transparent process guided by facts and without political interference. pic.twitter.com/1tbUVaNNec

Couldn’t agree more. Wisconsin cities & towns have been on the frontlines of the #COVID19 pandemic and they need more support from Washington to continue providing essential services and paying essential workers. twitter.com/leagueofcities…
.@realdonaldtrump came to Kenosha and announced federal funding that cannot be used for damages to small businesses that “got burned up – burned down.” He promised funding to rebuild, so @GovEvers and I are calling on Trump to deliver on his promises.
