To be clear: I am not currently president. But if you chip in now, we can change that in November: joe.link/35LrCCJ twitter.com/Acyn/status/13…

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for all of us. She was a giant of the Court and unflinching in her pursuit of equal justice under the law. Because of her life’s work, we are closer to that more perfect union we’ve always strived to be. pic.twitter.com/o30ZCuj10G
The Supreme Court is on the ballot. And the outcome will impact everything from health care to civil rights — affecting generations to come.

You deserve a President and Vice President who will spend every minute of every day working to make your life better.

I promise that’s exactly what @KamalaHarris and I will do.
Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico — but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria. It's unacceptable.

As president, I'll support the island's full recovery and invest in its people and future.
We’re going to get this virus under control and get your life back on track.
This election is Scranton vs. Park Avenue.
We’ve lost nearly 200,000 Americans to COVID-19. 

It didn’t have to be this bad — but Donald Trump failed to do his job.
We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing. 
 
We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine.

The stakes are too high.
If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.

The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families.

We're going to reward work — not wealth.
Donald Trump claimed he would be "the greatest jobs president God ever created."

But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history.

We can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. pic.twitter.com/uW10KJhMsV
President Trump promised the opioid crisis would end "quickly" if he won, but the fact is drug overdose deaths are up nearly 10% across the country. It's heartbreaking.

As president, I promise I'll take action to end this epidemic. joebiden.com/opioidcrisis/
Folks, I just wrapped up my first CNN Town Hall of the general election. We’re in the home stretch of this campaign and your support matters more than ever.

Chip in to help us keep tonight’s momentum going: joe.link/2RE6g1y
Hispanic Heritage Month is a reminder of the strength we draw as a nation from our immigrant roots. No matter where your family came from, we're here because we all share the same ideals. That's the story of America — and it is well worth celebrating. joebiden.com/2020/09/15/sta…
Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise.
.@realDonaldTrump, you know what’s actually threatening our suburbs?

Wildfires. Floods. Hurricanes.

We need to act on climate. Now.
.@realDonaldTrump, the job is to be president of all Americans. For the love of God start acting like it. twitter.com/arappeport/sta…

Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg.

Let's be honest: my campaign wouldn't be here if it weren't for the support of Black Americans. And I know we don't have a chance to win without your support.

I'll do everything I can to earn your vote—and together, we'll build a nation that works for all. #NationalBlackVoterDay twitter.com/NatUrbanLeague…

I can't believe I have to say this, but if I'm elected president, I won't put a climate change denier — one who called the scientific community "a bunch of thugs" — in charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/0…
When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us.

When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing.

When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found.

It's unforgivable.
Donald Trump claimed he would be "the greatest jobs president God ever created."

But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history.
