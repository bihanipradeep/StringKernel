NEW from @statnews: a recent @AARPpolicy study shows that the average annual cost for popular drugs has gone up $5,000 since 2006 when Medicare Part D went into effect. Under the @SenateFinance inflation penalty, that increase would have been just $500 over more than a decade. pic.twitter.com/WG48YHQYUB
.@RonWyden: Seniors w/ expensive prescriptions will finally have peace of mind because this proposal caps their out-of-pocket expenses in Medicare Part D. It will save seniors $27 billion in out-of-pocket costs. #StopRxGreed
Trump sold out Republican lawmakers by eliminating the benefit of charitable tax credit programs in their states. Rural hospitals in Georgia, child care centers in Missouri and charities in Kentucky that provide services to low-income Americans may have to close their doors. pic.twitter.com/XQrFLJOxqR

.@RonWyden: Today, lawyers representing the Trump administration and Republican governors are attempting to have the Affordable Care Act ripped up and thrown out by a federal court. They failed to get it done in Congress, so now theyâ€™re trying to do it in the courts.
Ranking Member @RonWyden and Chairman @ChuckGrassley today introduced legislation to address skyrocketing prescription drug costs. 

The Committee will hold a hearing on July 25, at 9:30 a.m. to consider this legislation. finance.senate.gov/ranking-memberâ€¦
.@RonWyden: Democrats in Congress have proposals ready to go that take a better approach and protect peopleâ€™s health care. 

âœ…Blocking Trumpâ€™s lawyers from using taxpayer dollars to destroy the ACA.
âœ…Banning junk insurance.
âœ…Standing in support of pre-existing conditions.
.@RonWyden: As people in Oregon and across the country attended 4th of July picnics and parades, it's likely that complicated health care policy debates were a big topic of conversation. 

I'm pretty sure that's the way the Trump administration wanted it.
