Now more than ever, we must protect Floridiansâ€™ rights to work safely, secure a retirement and earn a living wage. Iâ€™m proud to be endorsed by @SEIUFL and to join them and the entire labor movement in fighting for workers and their families. pic.twitter.com/uzs2TRd2Xe
Happy #NationalDogDay from our pack to yours! pic.twitter.com/PSaPqnvmD5
Today, District 23 voters overwhelmingly said they want a strong, pragmatic progressive in DC, someone to protect Social Security & Medicare, boldly confront climate change & aggressively act to alleviate the critical health & economic threats facing our nation. Thank you #FL23! pic.twitter.com/tsqayGUu4H

Ending gun violence changes & saves lives, and @BradyBuzz's comprehensive approach should be a model for congressional action.

The spouse of the next VP @KamalaHarris is a true mensch. @DouglasEmhoff shared a caring, genuine side w/ key So Fla Rabbinical leaders today. A strong value system was evident in his family story. He made it clear: with a Biden Harris ticket, we will #repairtheworld. #TeamJoe pic.twitter.com/u9mMwb4ch0
PMG DeJoy's changes are STILL slowing down SoFla mail, and it doesn't look like he has any interest in returning to business as usual. These attacks on the @USPS threaten our health, our economic recovery and our elections. nbcmiami.com/investigationsâ€¦
Happy 112th Anniversary to St. Ruthâ€™s Baptist Church of Dania Beach. Thank you Pastor Scott for all you do for the community and for making your congregation a loving, welcoming place for everyone. pic.twitter.com/eQxpKdE8Qd
.@GovRonDeSantis again waited until the last minute to extend FL's watered-down eviction moratorium, and hundreds of families are already feeling the pain. We are still in a recession, and kicking people out of their homes won't help it end any sooner.Â orlandosentinel.com/business/os-bzâ€¦
What an amazing line up at the #DemConvention Night 3. Itâ€™s always a powerful moment when we get to hear from strong women like my dear friend Gabby Giffords.   youtu.be/2xPKE0koJtc
This is a historic choice amidst many well-qualified choices on Bidenâ€™s short list, including Floridaâ€™s very own Val Demings. (3/5)
I want to thank all the primary voters who put their trust in me. It is an honor and privilege to represent you in our fight for a more just, compassionate and equitable America. Of course, thatâ€™s what this general election will be all about. pic.twitter.com/djmnZGX58r
Who else is ready to see two qualified, competent and caring people take back the White House this November?

Text 'READY' to 30330 and join the fight to bring the will of the people back to Washington! pic.twitter.com/jAgttb2gIz
Last night, @JoeBiden showed exactly why he deserves to be in the White House. Character, empathy and decency are on the ballot this November, let's make it count. twitter.com/JoeBiden/statuâ€¦
Amid the historic social unrest, pandemic and economic crisis this nation faces, this is the sharp, honest and steady leadership team that America needs right now. (5/5)

Are you kidding? Your horrible bill cuts trillions in aid from the #HeroesAct that the House PASSED IN MAY.Â Your bill doesn't even include funding for state & local govts to maintain necessary services, pay for our frontline workers, or stimulus checks for American families. twitter.com/senatemajldr/sâ€¦
This November, the choice is clear. #BidenHarris2020 will never put their personal electoral needs above the health and safety of Americans. Trump already has. #TrumpKnew
washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-wâ€¦
The Senate has sat on the #HeroesAct for 117 days. While they waste another week whipping for a bill that has no shot of passing, real people are still hurting. Tell McConnell to pass the Heroes Act today!Â Â npr.org/sections/healtâ€¦
#COVID has made phonebanking more crucial than ever before. Whether you're a campaign veteran or a first-timer, join @NikkiFried this Thursday for an evening of calls and let's make sure our next president is @JoeBiden!

Normalization with Israel can't be a quid pro quo for advanced weapons access. For Trump everything is transactional, not principle-based. A Biden/Harris Administration won't bargain away Israel's security. #TeamJoe

PMG DeJoy is doing everything to keep the USPS running slow, including blocking lawful Congressional oversight. What inside the Opa Locka sorting facility, and other sorting facilities, is he trying to hide from Americans?
forbes.com/sites/alisonduâ€¦
With Rxs, checks & other vital mail being delayed, PMG DeJoy blocked me from touring SoFla mail facilities this morning, just weeks ahead of a presidentialÂ election where mail-in ballots are vital for a safe election. What is DeJoy hiding from the public? nbcmiami.com/news/local/souâ€¦

To anyone seeking justice for #JacobBlake, this police chief inspires zero confidence that he will aggressively pursue it, or protect those who protest the lack of it.
