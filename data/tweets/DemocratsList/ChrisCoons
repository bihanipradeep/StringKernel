While I have not been officially briefed, I consider this threat credible based on previous attempts by Iran to target diplomats in other countries.
President Trump doesn’t have a health care plan. 

He’s never had a health care plan.

Make no mistake, General Qassem Soleimani was a terrorist responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American servicemembers, and the United States will not tolerate Iranian attacks on American citizens anywhere.
Last week, the Iranian government executed Navid Afkari, a wrestling champion, after he was arrested for joining anti-government protests & tortured into making a false confession. Today, we must continue to speak out about Iran’s human rights abuses & brutality.
We have strengthened our nation over generations by welcoming immigrants, whether they arrive seeking refuge or opportunity.

It’s my pleasure to join @LIRSorg to discuss the future of U.S. immigration policy.

I call on Tehran to stop arbitrarily detaining & holding hostage foreigners & Iranians alike. Tehran must immediately release Baquer & Siamak Namazi, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Nasrin Sotoudeh, & all those unjustly imprisoned.

Out of respect for her enormous contributions, with faith in our democracy, and mindful of the lasting consequences of her replacement, we should honor her final wish that she should be replaced only after the next presidential inauguration.
