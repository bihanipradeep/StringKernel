I’m grateful to announce @SenAngusKing has cosponsored the #BRIDGEAct—my bill to connect unserved neighborhoods, hospitals, schools & other areas to affordable, high-speed broadband.
 
We’re also seeing growing support from @CASBConnect, @ColoFarmBureau, @ruralhealth & more.
Here's the letter we wrote to the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee exactly one year ago: bennet.senate.gov/public/index.c…
"New funding is imperative to deploy this essential utility in support of economic development and the provision of essential public services..." 
 
@GovofCO is right. 
 
Broadband is essential to full participation in modern life—& I'm grateful for his support of our #BRIDGEAct.
If we’re going to keep up with changes to virtual school & work and compete with countries like China, we need future-proof broadband.
 
The #BRIDGEAct will invest in 21st century broadband that’s able to meet America’s needs today—and for years to come.

Few Americans have done as much as Ruth Bader Ginsburg to pull America closer to its ideals. Her tenacity, brilliance, and moral compass will be deeply missed, especially at this fraught moment. My thoughts are with her family and loved ones.
William Pendley’s extremist ideology does not perceive how public lands are foundational to our economy and way of life as Coloradans.
 
Someone who’s spent his entire career opposed to the very idea of public lands is unfit to lead a land management agency. Period. pic.twitter.com/UMWiP4okga

As @BVSDcolorado's Chief Technology Officer, @InnovateMoore knows how imperative the internet is to learning. The #BRIDGEAct will help give students the education they deserve.
Colorado was the first state to pass a police accountability bill this summer—setting the standard for Washington.

I've joined @SenBooker & @SenKamalaHarris in introducing the #JusticeInPolicingAct.

Last week USPS sent a mailer incorrectly telling people in Colorado to request mail ballots even though our state automatically sends them to all registered voters. 
 
The mailer sowed needless confusion and should never have gone out to Coloradans.

This is a great tool for voters in all 64 counties in CO to track their ballot this fall. It's one more way our state continues to lead the nation in making it accessible, safe, and secure for everyone to cast their ballot and participate in our democracy.denverpost.com/2020/09/12/col…
Today I celebrated a new partnership in Denver between @ClaytonLearning and @garycommunity’s COVIDCheck Colorado program that will offer testing to Clayton’s teachers, staff, students and their households. pic.twitter.com/jjPJxtyzFV
For months, we’ve called on the administration to end MFAR, a policy that would have led to across the board cuts to Medicaid and undermined vital care for kids and families during the pandemic.
 
I'm glad to see @SeemaCMS is heeding our call and withdrawing the policy. twitter.com/SeemaCMS/statu…
ICYMI: @SenToddYoung & I wrote an op-ed about our bipartisan #RESTART Act & how it will help the hardest-hit small businesses stay afloat into 2021.

Read more to hear why we're calling on Congress to include RESTART in the next COVID relief package ⬇️ bennet.senate.gov/public/index.c…
The president ignored the science on climate change and #COVID19. Now all of us are paying the price.
 
Mr. President, America was able to harness electricity, invent the telephone, and put a man on the moon by embracing science, not denying it. twitter.com/ABC/status/130…
As a country, we have failed to invest in modern broadband for everyone, leaving 17 million students without access to the internet at home.
Our #BRIDGEAct will provide funding to states & tribal govts to deploy affordable, high-speed broadband. My op-ed⬇️

Trump’s decision to end #TPS betrays our values. The program offers safety to thousands of immigrants who would otherwise face severe hardship. All have passed background tests. Most have lived here for decades, contributing to America. Congress must act.

cnn.com/2020/09/14/pol…
Congress should pass a relief package that extends the expanded unemployment benefit; provides funding for state & local governments; supports our hardest-hit small businesses with my #RESTARTAct; and invests in our public health infrastructure by establishing a #HealthForce.
Few Americans have done as much as Ruth Bader Ginsburg to pull America closer to its ideals. Her tenacity, brilliance, and moral compass will be deeply missed, especially at this fraught moment. My thoughts are with her family and loved ones.

There’s no greater responsibility as Colorado’s senator than being responsive to the needs of Coloradans.

Colorado is leading the country to tackle #climatechange & build a clean energy future.
