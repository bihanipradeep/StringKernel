Thank you to all the New Mexico Delegates for representing our great state at the #DemocraticConvention. Now we must continue the hard work of getting @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris elected this November.
At the #DemConvention, @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris showed America that they are the leaders this nation needs. Now we must work our hearts out to make sure the Biden-Harris ticket wins New Mexico & wins this election. Let’s get out there and vote to restore our democracy.
Thank you, @JoeBiden. The Grand Canyon is irreplaceable—sacred to Tribes & treasured by all Americans.

It’s outrageous that Donald Trump wants to let uranium mining corps near the Grand Canyon. Americans are sick and tired of Trump selling our public lands to the highest bidder. twitter.com/JoeBiden/statu…
I will do everything I can to make sure @JoeBiden wins #NewMexico in the fall and puts an end to the disastrous nightmare of the Trump presidency once and for all. - TU
As vice chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, I'm proud to stand with @JoeBiden, who will listen to Native American Tribes and protect the lands, rights, and future of Indian Country--unlike the current president.
@JoeBiden will defeat @realDonaldTrump and he will be an outstanding president for *all* Americans. He will stand up for working people who have been left behind by this president, and he will restore the soul of this nation that has come under attack from President Trump.
I want to thank @BernieSanders for the incredible race he has run. I know that he will never stop fighting for working people and for the progressive values that must define our path forward, and that he will continue to be a leading voice in our coalition.
We need clear-eyed, principled, and steadfast leadership for the working families of New Mexico and this nation. The leader we need is Joe Biden.

That's why today, I am enormously proud to endorse @JoeBiden for president.
I am forever grateful for your friendship, support, and commitment. - TU tomudall.com/landing/s19032…
That’s why it means so much to me to know that I can count on you to stand with me over these next two years – and beyond – in the fight to save our planet and our Democracy and protect the most vulnerable among us.
I want you to be the first to know that I’ve decided not to run for re-election next year. Now I am most certainly not retiring. I’m absolutely committed to changing the course that this President has set for our country.
It was wonderful to watch my friend @Michelle4NM be sworn in yesterday as Governor of New Mexico. She's a fantastic champion for all New Mexicans and I know she'll do a great job representing us. - TU pic.twitter.com/dIfTU3utXr

Scott Pruitt has got to go. He’s been a menace to the environment and a drain on government resources. He’s rolled back protections that keep our air and water clean, while spending taxpayer dollars on travel perks. Call for his resignation. nm.tomudall.com/w180406
