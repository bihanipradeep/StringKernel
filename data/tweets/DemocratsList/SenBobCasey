The Trump/Republican lawsuit against affordable health care & the botched pandemic response are inexcusable. I'm joining @ProtectOurCare @RepCartwright & others to call for an end to the GOP‚Äôs war on Pennsylvanians‚Äô health care. Watch LIVE at 11:45 AM ET: fb.me/e/3bNKWDS8C
One step toward dismantling systemic racism is through education. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm also proud to have introduced the 1619 Act with several of my colleagues, aimed at increasing awareness and understanding of African American history.
This is about Antwon Rose. And it‚Äôs also about Breonna Taylor. George Floyd. Philando Castile. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. It's about not looking away. It‚Äôs about reforming our systems and committing to try and right injustice wherever we see it.
This pandemic disproportionately impacts Black residents in nursing homes. That's why I sent a letter with Sen. @RonWyden @SenWarren & @PattyMurray calling for more thorough data collection from CMS and CDC. There‚Äôs no way you can respond to the problem unless you have the data. twitter.com/washingtonpost‚Ä¶
The #COVID19 crisis has underscored the need for a robust health care infrastructure and medical research. NIH funding must be a national priority so we can invest in research that leads to more progress, more solutions and more lives saved. #Members4MedicalResearch @RallyForNIH
Consistent with the precedent set by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2016, Justice Ginsburg‚Äôs seat should not be filled until the presidential election concludes and the candidate chosen by voters is sworn into office.
The Morning Call is not only a source of high-quality, local news for the Lehigh Valley, but a pillar of the community. Vacating the downtown office building after 100 years represents a great loss for Allentown... (1/2) twitter.com/mcallguild/sta‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs obscene that the Trump Administration would rather promote these types of plans than keep them from harming American consumers.
Proud to score a perfect üíØ on @cleanh2oaction's scorecard for this Congress. It's obscene that the GOP-controlled Senate has brushed aside critical health and climate legislation. Today and every day, I'm committed to building the just, sustainable future we all deserve. twitter.com/CleanH2OPA/sta‚Ä¶
#NEW: At the request of myself and @SenStabenow, a new investigative report shows that Americans with pre-existing conditions were sold junk health care plans that don‚Äôt cover their medical needs.
"Postmaster General Louis DeJoy‚Äôs controversial midsummer operational directives delayed nearly 350 million pieces‚Ä¶of the country‚Äôs first-class mail in the five weeks they were in effect."

This is a five-alarm fire for our democracy. washingtonpost.com/business/2020/‚Ä¶
Tonight our Nation mourns the passing of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Ginsburg was a pioneer for gender equality, a champion for human rights and a fierce defender of workers on an increasingly corporate Supreme Court.
As my colleague @SenStabenow said of Sec. Perdue, "he certainly put together a program that favored the crops in his state.‚Äù

Don't let this report be buried. This is alarming for the equity and support our small businesses and working families deserve.
It's been just over 2 years since unarmed, 17-yr old Antwon Rose was killed by police in East Pittsburgh. Antwon should be alive today. I commend the @steelers for honoring his memory and sharing his story on one of the biggest stages imaginable. twitter.com/steelers/statu‚Ä¶
Just one example: in Pennsylvania, the average payment rate in 2019 was $8,661 per farmer. The average payment rate nationally was nearly doubly that rate, and in Georgia, the average farmer received $42,545 per farmer, almost 5 times that rate in Pennsylvania.

57 years ago today, these little girls were senselessly murdered in the 16th St. Baptist Church bombing. We must honor their memory by fighting against the hate & bigotry that stole their lives wherever we see it.
COVID is disproportionately killing Black Americans, and the Admin is contributing to it. Instead of focusing on corporate liability shields, Senate GOP needs to work with @SenateDems to pass legislation to address the crisis in our nursing homes and among Black Americans.

Justice Ginsburg served our Nation honorably and with distinction for four decades. Her heroic battles with cancer inspired countless Americans. I extend condolences to her family and may her memory be a blessing to millions of Americans.

DSPs make up the dedicated and innovative workforce that is the heart and soul of support for people with disabilities. While Senate Republicans cast them aside, I will continue to fight for increased pay, better benefits and workplace protections for these workers.
It‚Äôs National DSP Recognition Week! I applaud the incredible work of Direct Support Professionals (DSPs) across Pennsylvania and the country. DSPs ensure people with disabilities have the supports to live, work and enjoy life more independently in the community. #DSPRW2020 pic.twitter.com/IGG28WpVHc

The unwillingness to pass legislation so we can protect our democracy, along with refusal to provide all members with comprehensive intel briefings on election security, is a dereliction of duty by Senate GOP.
FBI Director Wray: Russia has made "active efforts" to influence the 2020 election.
