As you might know, @TimsDesiree, running for Congress in #OH10, was once a member of my team. Tonight I was proud to join a call hosted by former members of my staff to support her campaign. The Gillifam is cheering you on, Desiree! If you are too: secure.actblue.com/donate/ots_dti… pic.twitter.com/FgZ2qQRgzd

TODAY @ 11AM ET: I'm excited to lead a conversation with students and young voters in New Hampshire as part of the Youth for Biden Virtual Bus Tour—it's sure to be a great discussion. If you're in New Hampshire, I hope you'll stop by: mobilize.us/organizenh/eve… pic.twitter.com/Bcy8SPnTxV
The postmaster general has made sweeping changes to @USPS operations that have jeopardized a service that millions of Americans rely on. We're doing everything we can to hold him accountable and ensure that the Postal Service has the resources it needs. pic.twitter.com/xV9spbWJfL
Women of color led in the fight for suffrage. However, many of them had to continue the fight for voting rights for decades after the 19th Amendment was ratified. 

That fight continues to this day. On #WomensEqualityDay, we recognize a few of the unsung leaders of the movement. pic.twitter.com/HnY2RurxeI
Congratulations, @JoeBiden, on accepting the Democratic nomination for president and for a beautiful #DemConvention. 

I am so hopeful—and I am excited to see you win in November. Now, it's up to us to do our part. Let's go: iwillvote.com
McConnell wants to force a vote on a new justice. It’s up to all of us—Senators like myself, advocates, citizens—to fight to keep this seat open until the next president and Senate are sworn in. That starts with doing all we can to help Dems win in Nov. I’m ready to get to work.
If you haven't had the chance to watch to my friend @GabbyGiffords's speech at @demconvention last night, please do. 

With boundless courage, she reminds us of what's at stake, why we're all in this fight, and why we all must vote in November. pic.twitter.com/HZVnRhsPSK
As we reflect on the legacy Justice Ginsburg leaves behind, we must also recommit to her unending fight for justice. 

It's our turn to carry the mantle. 

I've set up an emergency fund to raise $100k for the five women that will flip the Senate: secure.actblue.com/donate/ots_sen…
Imagine if your post office could provide basic, low cost banking services. 

It's a simple idea that could help millions of Americans and make our banking system more fair. 

I'm working with @BernieSanders to make postal banking a reality.

Every child deserves the chance to be raised by loving parents, regardless of the parents’ gender identity, sexual orientation, or religion. I’m leading an amicus brief in Fulton v. the City of Philadelphia to finally end this kind of discrimination in foster care and adoption.
To flip the Senate, we have to make sure that incumbent Democratic Senators (my friends @CoryBooker, @JeanneShaheen, @GaryPeters, @DougJones, @TinaSmithMN, @MarkWarner) have what they need to face attacks by their Republican challengers. Will you help?

As many families across the country struggle to keep food on the table, we have a moral obligation to ensure that children aren't going hungry during this pandemic.

Millions of Americans have lost jobs, paychecks, and the ability to keep food on the table. Congress needs to extend desperately needed relief—food assistance, rental assistance. We have the ability to alleviate suffering, let’s do it now.
Today, President Trump visited a food distribution plant in North Carolina. With millions struggling to put food on the table, we need a president who will actually *do* the work to help fix our hunger crisis by extending SNAP benefits, not just stand for empty photo ops.
Nearly 30 million people are out of work.

Tens of thousands are contracting COVID each day.

Millions are struggling to pay rent and keep food on the table.

But instead of addressing these needs, McConnell has put out a relief bill that prioritizes the needs of corporations.
The alleged horrors described here—of immigrant women being forced into hysterectomies—are egregious human rights abuses. We cannot look away from this. They must be thoroughly investigated and those responsible should be held accountable.

The fact that the Republican “skinny” bill prioritizes blanket liability for corporations over the health and safety of the working people who are keeping this country running is insulting.
As much as President Trump and many Republicans want to pretend that COVID has magically gone away, it hasn’t.

To act like it has is an affront to the lives lost and the millions of families who have been affected.

It’s also a recipe for disaster.

I have faith that Congress can step up to help these veterans. I'm looking forward to working with Jon Stewart and John Feal to get it done. twitter.com/MoveOn/status/…
Our country's ongoing hunger crisis has been made even worse by the pandemic. These images and stories are heart wrenching. Americans are struggling to feed themselves and their families—and the federal government can and should do more to provide relief.

McConnell's "skinny" package doesn't come close to providing any of the real relief that families, businesses, and our communities desperately need. People across the country are struggling to keep food on the table and make rent. We need to do better than this. twitter.com/politico/statu…
Extending food assistance benefits would go a long way toward relieving some of the suffering that families are facing during this pandemic. Congress needs to get it done.
This #LaborDay, I’m thinking of the essential workers who remain at the frontlines of our country’s response to the COVID crisis. They deserve meaningful protections from Congress—including premium compensation, paid sick and family leave, and health and safety protections.
Enjoying your #LaborDay weekend? Thank a union. Unions have played critical roles in the fight for equality. They are our teachers, our nurses, our essential workers. We recommit to strengthening their power.
On #LaborDay, let’s recommit to our fight for policies that will support our working families year-round, like a national $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, strong unions and collective bargaining, and equal pay for equal work.
The pandemic has exposed just how much more we need to do to support American workers and their families. With millions struggling to make ends meet, we need to extend unemployment benefits, offer paid family leave and sick days, and address our ongoing hunger crisis. #LaborDay
In spite of the many challenges we face—and the work that remains to ensure that working families get the relief and support they deserve—I hope that you and yours have a safe and restful Labor Day.
Millions of Americans have lost jobs, paychecks, and the ability to keep food on the table. Congress needs to extend desperately needed relief—food assistance, rental assistance. We have the ability to alleviate suffering, let’s do it now.
Our servicemembers deserve a commander-in-chief who values their work and sacrifice.
Over the past few months, I visited 14 food pantries across New York. Many of these places have lines around the block. Families are struggling—and Congress needs to do more. It's unconscionable that Sen. McConnell won't consider extending the SNAP benefits they need.
Stars and Stripes has supported and informed our service members for over 150 years. Now, Trump is moving to dissolve it without explanation, a clear attack on free press. We need accountability.

I am so enraged and disturbed by Daniel Prude's death. He should still be with us. My heart breaks for his family—and I'm glad steps are being taken toward the accountability they deserve. twitter.com/nytimes/status…
Despite the promises made in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, many public servants still have no guarantee that their student loans won’t hang over their heads for the rest of their lives. It isn't right. Congress needs to fix this program.
