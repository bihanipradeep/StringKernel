Nah. Mother does that for him. pic.twitter.com/AR8E2acZIb
Sorry
There's a convention going on?
How you been?
The far right has been emboldened since he was elected. Charlotsville, etc. All of this will be used by the Trump admin to show that a democratic leadership will lead to unrest. It's a shitshow.
Unfortunately I don't have much faith in the choices of the American electorate after 2016.
Only takes like few thousand in a few certain states to guarantee another 4 years of Trump and possibly the end of our democracy.
I keep waiting for these Femme Bots to malfunction on live TV. #RNCConvention2020 pic.twitter.com/P9fUO24tMJ
I would say lock her up but she is already the Slovenian Rapunzel.
I don't believe in binary choices.
I'll take door #3. Little bit of socialism hold the authoritarianism with extra democracy.

I know. Unfortunately, not voting is the same as voting for him. I'm worried.
I think he will too. I also think that his blatant misuse of power and shredding of laws and political norms means real trouble for this country. Especially for those that aren't a part of his base.
The fact that people buy this is the fault of Biden(Democrats as a whole) and not the racist in chief who stokes the division daily is beyond me. I've lost hope in this country.
No I agree. We shouldn't give in to pressure and they should continue protesting. I don't agree with the rioting but as MLK said it is often the voice of the unheard. I just am worried.
No idea. Been watching this documentary about mental illness that they're broadcasting on all the news channels.
It is kind of embarrassing. Makes for good TV.
We need more LGBTQ gear on the joebiden.com store @TeamJoe @JoeBiden. I need stuff to spend my monies on to support my girl @KamalaHarris.
"It's pretty sexist that women get Mother's Day, Labor Day, and hush money payments for sleeping with me." - Donald Trump, probably.
A Trump Boat parade on Lake Travis in my hometown of Austin got into trouble when their boats took on water from the turbulent water and sank. The irony is astounding.
The Mexican Pizza at @tacobell was legit the only reason to go there. 2020 has gone too far. pic.twitter.com/ekcv8qgVpv
Not all democratic socialists believe that capitalism is wrong. Just that it requires regulating and programs to tame the flaws.
You seem upset. Not sure why you would be unless you are indeed a stupid white man.
I haven't met 57% of white men but that ratio of stupidity seems legit.
Yes. Life long socialist democrat. Liberal. Been out since the 90s. Total nazi. ðŸ™„

In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous. In America, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit. These are their Trump stories. twitter.com/realDonaldTrumâ€¦

I don't care what she has done, is doing, or will do. You bitches will not mess with Adele. 2020 be dammed. I will not have it.
This joke of a President recirculated the phone number of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and a tweet calling him a fucking idiot. Yes, this is Trump's America and he is inciting and supporting the violence in this country. He is responsible. He is the President. This is his watch.
