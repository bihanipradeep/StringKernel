Grateful for my friend and colleague Senator Chris Murphy and his fight to provide justice and opportunity to college athletes. Please tune in now to watch this important hearing: help.senate.gov twitter.com/ByBerkowitz/st…
These horrific allegations and long-standing mistreatment at detention centers are why immigrants should not be unnecessarily detained during a pandemic. Congress should pass my FIRST Act to ensure immigrants are protected.

This #NJBudget will help New Jersey families who need it most, invest in our schools & communities, and spur our state’s economic recovery. Grateful for the work of @GovMurphy & the NJ Legislature championing this plan for a stronger & fairer New Jersey. nytimes.com/2020/09/17/nyr…
America must honor its commitments to international partners like the WHO—especially during this pandemic where a coordinated global response to #COVID19 is vital to saving lives at home & abroad. My bill with @SenatorDurbin reaffirms this commitment.insidernj.com/press-release/…

The whistleblower complaint detailing heinous abuses to immigrant detainees under ICE custody—including subjecting female detainees to hysterectomies at alarming rates, medical neglect & more—must be investigated. I’ve written to @DHSOIG to find answers. booker.senate.gov/news/press/sen…
Today kicks off #HHM celebrating Latinx, Latino & Hispanic Americans’ rich heritage & contributions to our nation. The Latino community faces many challenges—from being disproportionately harmed by #COVID19 & climate change to heartless immigration policies—we must keep fighting.
Last year banks made $12 billion on overdraft fees—burdensome charges that typically fall on those already on the financial brink. Banks shouldn’t be allowed to charge these fees. I have a bill with @SenSherrodBrown that will end this exploitative practice.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/td-…
Proud to join many of my Democratic colleagues, activists and advocates to propose this bold THRIVE agenda that would create millions of union jobs, revive our economy and address major crises from climate change to racial injustice to economic inequity. twitter.com/verge/status/1…
This whistleblower report is further evidence of a pattern of behavior designed to obscure Trump’s relationship with Russia. Congress must be briefed on this report & anyone deliberately withholding critical information regarding our national security must be held accountable. twitter.com/nytimes/status…
The bipartisan Senate Intelligence report confirms that Russia attacked our 2016 election and that the Trump campaign welcomed Russia’s help. Republicans in Congress who don’t stand up to foreign interference in our elections are inviting more. nytimes.com/2020/08/18/us/…
Climate change is the greatest existential threat of our lifetime. We must take aggressive action to achieve net zero emissions as quickly as possible—that’s why Democrats are fighting to build a clean energy economy. Read the #CaseForClimateAction report: democrats.senate.gov/climate-report
Hundreds of sorting machines have recently been removed resulting in reports of mail delays. The USPS itself warned 46 states that voters could be disenfranchised by delayed mail-in ballots. It's not enough to stop these harmful policies—they must be reversed. twitter.com/ABC/status/129…
This is horrific. There must be an immediate investigation into these disturbing allegations of human rights abuse. twitter.com/CNN/status/130…
This crisis has demonstrated the desperate need to close the wealth gap. I applaud @GovMurphy for taking action today for a better tomorrow. nytimes.com/2020/09/08/opi…
This is a big win for clean energy as well as for American consumers—I applaud @FERChatterjee & @RichGlickFERC for their work on bringing this historic rule across the finish line. twitter.com/FERChatterjee/…
Trump is actively and openly sabotaging the USPS ahead of the November elections. Mitch McConnell should call back the Senate to protect the USPS—and finally pass critical #COVID19 relief. The Senate should not be on vacation right now. nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/…
This is unacceptable. In one of the world's richest countries it's unconscionable that many American families can't afford food. Congress must quickly act on a #COVID19 relief package to provide food assistance such as SNAP benefits to those that need it.cbpp.org/blog/food-need…
Farming in the last 70 years has gone from raising animals in a far more humane, pasture-based model to big factory farming that’s harmful to public health, workers & our environment. It’s time we end this broken system with my Farm System Reform Act. vox.com/future-perfect…
In our nation, the biggest determining factor of whether you live near toxic pollution, drink contaminated water, or breathe dirty air is the color of your skin & your economic status. My bill with @repdebhaaland seeks to end this environmental injustice. booker.senate.gov/news/press/sen…

Every year tens of thousands of Americans lose their lives to suicide—the 10th leading cause of death in the US. For those struggling, know you are not alone. If you need help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 #WorldSuicidePreventionDay
The paltry fine that OSHA imposed on Smithfield confirms what we already knew—that during this pandemic Smithfield put profits before the health of its workers & the local community. Smithfield’s actions led to workers getting sick & dying. There must be real accountability. twitter.com/fatimathefatim…
The Senate Republican #COVID19 bill doesn’t provide for food assistance, rental assistance, hazard pay, election security, and more—this is unacceptable. Congress must pass a bill that meets the urgent demands of working Americans and their families. cnn.com/2020/09/08/pol…
Nearly 190,000 Americans are dead. Trump knew how deadly this virus was and chose to downplay and lie to the American people. Trump’s lack of moral leadership during this time of crisis is truly unforgivable. cnn.com/2020/09/09/pol…
House Democrats passed a #COVID19 relief package back in May that met the urgent needs of Americans during this pandemic. The Senate Republican bill is months late and doesn’t come close to meeting the moment. We must do better. huffpost.com/entry/coronavi…
As the Senate returns today, we can’t waste any time to adequately fund the US Postal Service. We must pass legislation now before it’s too late—our democracy depends on it. nj.com/opinion/2020/0…
My grandfather's union membership gave him better wages & benefits that got our family out of poverty & into the middle class. I celebrate #LaborDay with a deep appreciation for the right to organize & why I'm here today. We must always fight for workers’ rights.
Farming in the last 70 years has gone from raising animals in a far more humane, pasture-based model to big factory farming that’s harmful to public health, workers & our environment. It’s time we end this broken system with my Farm System Reform Act. vox.com/future-perfect…
Trump has repeatedly chosen to foment division and unrest over addressing the damage to our nation. We need moral leadership to stand up to these incitements to violence. newyorker.com/news/our-colum…
Unemployment claims remain high & Congress still hasn't passed the next relief bill to help millions of Americans through this crisis. The House passed the HEROES Act back in May—it’s inexcusable that Senate Republican leadership has delayed this long.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/bus…

The US is 4% of the world’s population yet has 24% of its #COVID19 cases. More than 180,000 Americans have died. We need a president who listens to health experts—not one who blindly demands that schools and businesses reopen in the middle of a pandemic. cbsnews.com/news/coronavir…
Today rent is due for millions of Americans who have struggled to pay their bills during this pandemic—and many  face eviction. Congress passed eviction protection in the last #COVID19 relief package but it recently expired—Congress must address this now. nytimes.com/2020/08/29/opi…
It’s not enough to end the federal prohibition on marijuana—we must expunge the records and repair the damage done to those communities who were harmed by the failed War on Drugs. This bill does this and more to achieve long overdue restorative justice.

Far too often college athletes are robbed of their college education—educational opportunities that they deserve and have earned. Just 55 percent of Black male athletes from the power 5 conferences graduate within six years. This has to change. usatoday.com/story/sports/c…

Today is the 57th anniversary of the historic March on Washington—a movement for justice, equality and dignity for all Americans that the moral conscience of our country continues to call for today. We must carry on this critical and necessary work—the dream still demands it.
