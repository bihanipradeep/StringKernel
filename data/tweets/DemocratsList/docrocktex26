😂🤣 All I can do is bless her heart.
Q is inextricably linked to racism, misogyny, homophobia/transphobia and White supremacy in general so it’s a proxy for all the same bigotry that lives within these people but isn’t morally or socially acceptable outside the walls of the cult. It’s a safe space for bigots/idiots.
I rolled my eyes so hard at that part and still don’t trust her judgment. Same time I’m 100% certain that this is how the vast majority of women who vote Republican in TX make their voting decisions. 🙃
Probably that devil DeJoy. 😒
Wow. Last time I checked in on this story it was 3. 😔
I haven’t received any of my merch yet and I’m pissed about it. It feels intentional to me.
America’s a rolling disaster b/c White supremacists are in power. Stop omitting that detail from your hot takes. The GOP isn’t just usurping power for power’s sake, they’re doing it for the purpose of upholding White patriarchy/theocracy/supremacy, indefinitely. Tell the truth.
Lmao! 😂🤣 It had to be spoken.

Sadly there isn’t really a tried & true approach to firm, fixed delusions and false beliefs, especially not when they’re the membership and language of a cult following. In most instances the cult would rather destroy its own self than coexist with a reality it doesn’t accept.
🔥💣🔥💣🔥💣🔥 About damn time. Gotta be in it to win it. #ExpectUsRegardless #FlipItBlueTX
I don’t think it necessarily requires Trump to sustain itself b/c the bigoted beliefs are easily transferable and have been passed down for centuries in America. He’s certainly activated them but they were primed for it generations ago & Putin knew they were itching to Whitelash.
Everything the GOP stands for is a hate crime against humanity.
Everything they want the SCOTUS for is a crime against humanity. 
Everything they want Congress for is a crime against humanity. 
Everything they want the WH for is a crime against humanity. 
Everything they want the state legislatures for is a crime against humanity.
Apart from that, I think it speaks volumes (but not in a good way) that we literally have to wait for breaking news to come from books because most MSM coverage is negligent/malfeasant bullshit rooted in pretending Trump isn’t a THREAT to our basic survival. #AmericanSociopath
It totally does, they clearly know where the merch is coming from and where they don’t want it to go, especially when it’s obviously a yard sign or t-shirt. They want Trump to have ALL the visibility, makes it easier to keep their psyops going. Plus I’m in the TX burbs. 🕵🏾‍♀️
The safer and more validated they feel amongst themselves, the more loyal they become to the delusions that bind them together. I honestly don’t think anything can deprogram them at this point, they’re clearly willing to die on a hill of bullshit. 🥴

Mmm hmm. Reminds me of this: 🌲 twitter.com/docrocktex26/s… pic.twitter.com/Den4IJHv52
No but thank you so kindly for making me aware of it. 😂🔥💣
I’m amazed and horrified at the same time. 😱
Yeah they were purty 🤪 I’ve never had any like the ones you have here though. We just fertilized the grass too, great minds. pic.twitter.com/qh7ey2QrTg
Not only that but they also have known criminal Ken Paxton and a stable full of batshit judges backing them all the way. All they’re doing is opening up to shut right back down and premeditating manslaughter. #GOPGenocide #MAGAMasochism
And just yesterday somebody on here (who’s not a Texan) took issue w/me calling out these sociopath TX Republicans for trying to railroad kids back to school in the midst of this data collection shit show. 😒 It’s not just the superintendent, it’s angry hordes of GOP parents too.
It’s still 80s-90s here but we’ve got tons of mushrooms too, my 6 year old talks trash to them before stomping on them and ripping them out of the ground. 🤭 It’s a whole vendetta that I didn’t see coming.
I love y’all and this pic. 🤗🥰😍
👏🏾 That’s a school I’d be proud to send my kids to, especially judging from how much it’s pissing off the racists in these replies.
Matter of fact there’s plenty of blame to assign across the entire American media landscape b/c the evidence that Trump was intentionally ignoring grave COVID intelligence warnings to spread lethal propaganda (and the virus) was plain as day yet they persisted in propping him up. twitter.com/docrocktex26/s…
I love how they wasted NO time. Wide Awake Joe. 🤩 pic.twitter.com/KZebuVBNbu

In other words... twitter.com/docrocktex26/s…
It’s not just that #TrumpKnew, it’s that Fox did too yet continued to blatantly spread public health misinformation (in addition to their typical fascist neurotoxin) while knowing full well they’d be culpable for mass casualties. The wind beneath a sociopath’s wings. twitter.com/docrocktex26/s…
Trump told a big enough lie and repeated it enough times that his most devoted enablers and sycophants believed it. Essential to that repetitious indoctrination was/is Fox “News”, they’re an accomplice to this genocide and he couldn’t have done it without them. twitter.com/docrocktex26/s…
Now *that* sounds more like it. Trump is litigious as fuck and blatantly using the DOJ to shield himself from prosecution and/or defamation, plus he’s been making fascist threats against journalists this whole time so BW should probably throw in a security detail while he’s at it
Me too. Especially the Senate GOP because they had ample time to remove him before COVID19 made it to our shores but they all REFUSED with PRIDE. The protests need to move to wherever the GOP Congress is right now because it’s up to them to stop/remove him stat.
Nope. Not buying it. 🗑 pic.twitter.com/hmS2ExMdQC

Not for one millisecond. I listened without reading the transcript on the screen but was waiting for him to say exactly what he said the whole time Woodward was talking. Racists outright reject White privilege as a whole concept. Black grievance too.
