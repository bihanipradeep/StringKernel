Ignore the polls. We've got 50 days left to do everything we can to elect @JoeBiden, flip the Senate, and expand our House majority.

Let's make every minute count.
May we help more than we hurt, may we seek to understand more than be understood and may we love more than we judge.
Amen. twitter.com/ruth_franklin/…
If you don't want Donald Trump appointing even more far-right justices to the Supreme Court, then please join me in working as hard as we can to elect @JoeBiden.

The orange skies of San Francisco are an urgent call to action. Climate change is an existential threat that demands our immediate attention. It's time we started acting like it. twitter.com/OmarJimenez/st…
Today we remember the beautiful souls lost on September 11, 2001. We also remember the extraordinary heroism of the brave first responders and all who stepped up to help their fellow Americans in the face of unspeakable violence and tragedy.

Never forget.
I am so, so saddened by the news that Ruth Bader Ginsburg has passed. Justice Ginsburg was a trailblazer and an extraordinary jurist who devoted her life to advancing the causes of equality and justice. We are in her debt.

May her memory be a blessing to us all.
Donald Trump has failed our children. twitter.com/CAPAction/stat…

You both are such blessings to me. Thank you for your lifting and encouraging me. Fayde is,and will increasingly be, a great leader.
Mitch McConnell needs to stop playing politics. We must immediately pass a robust relief package in the Senate that expands unemployment, protects families from eviction, and helps small businesses stay afloat.

The time for moral leadership is now.
Our broken food system has been taken over by massive corporations who put profits over workers, consumers, the environment, public health, and the well-being of animals.

Factory farming is a danger to our society.
