Today is #BlackWomensEqualPay Day! Black women are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic both at work and at home. They deserve #equalpay. pic.twitter.com/AJA0lMTt2c
This pandemic has left no American family untouched. Our country desperately needs a President who can create a comprehensive action plan to stop the spread of this virus and end this national crisis.

100 years ago today, the #19thAmendment was ratified. I wrote this essay for @amhistorymuseum on how far we’ve come, all the women who got us here, and the women leaders yet to come: americanhistory.si.edu/creating-icons… #SenatorsOnSuffrage
Pres. Trump admitted to sabotaging @USPS – attacking our democracy & hurting millions of people in MI who rely on the Post Office. 

Michiganders spoke out so the Postmaster General temporarily paused some of these harmful actions. We must continue the pressure! #DontMessWithUSPS pic.twitter.com/jv7PebxoNM
It's time for the USDA to stop making excuses and take action to keep our kids fed during this pandemic. pic.twitter.com/4JYWvXUhnz
200,000 Americans have now died from COVID-19. My heart goes out to the parents, children, brothers, sisters, coworkers, and friends who have lost their loved ones.
Mental illness and substance use disorders affect so many in Michigan and across the country. We must make sure people with behavioral health disorders have the support and treatment they need to build successful and healthy lives. #NationalRecoveryMonth pic.twitter.com/oxmJCMFEFX
Our nation’s servicemembers are heroes, not suckers or losers. They deserve a place of honor at the front of the line and they deserve a Commander in Chief who respects them and honors their service. twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1…

We must act NOW and pass this bill immediately.

Tonight we have lost an incredible voice for justice. As a lawyer and professor, Justice Ginsburg broke barriers for women. As a Justice of the Supreme Court, she helped build a better nation for all Americans. We must honor her legacy by continuing her fight. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/IcxNeA9FgA
It is outrageous that the Trump Administration is reportedly considering taking $300 million away from our farmers to bail out oil companies. Over and over, the Trump Administration has sided with Big Oil over Michigan farmers. Enough is enough! pic.twitter.com/4ZiV4qF90U

COVID-19 is shining a light on generations of discrimination that are leaving people of color most vulnerable to the economic fallout from this pandemic. @SenateDems introduced the Economic Justice Act to tackle these inequalities.

It’s September 1 & the Trump Administration still doesn’t have a national testing strategy. 
 
@SenSchumer and I raised the alarm about this on April 15. It's been almost 5 months with over 180,000 lives lost & the President still hasn't taken action. 
 
Shameful & heartbreaking!
Important news- after weeks of pressing, the @USDA has agreed to extend important school meal flexibilities. This is a positive first step forward that will ensure millions of children in Michigan and across the country will receive healthy food.

This decision is completely irresponsible. Widespread testing is necessary to get people back to work safely and save lives. 
 
The Trump Administration should be putting science above politics.
