If Republicans recklessly & reprehensibly force a SCOTUS vote before the election—nothing is off the table.
The alleged conduct outlined in this whistleblower complaint is depraved & cruel. A hysterectomy performed without informed consent or good reason is not just an unnecessary medical procedure—it is a violation of fundamental human rights. cnn.com/2020/09/15/pol…
Lies cost lives. The culture enabling these lies must be ended through systematic reform. Legislation is a start, but individual accountability is vital—for justice to the victims & deterrence of future lies. nytimes.com/2020/09/16/bus…
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a giant. The world is a different place because of her. More than the laws she forged are the lives she touched. She will always be an American icon—breaking barriers w/courage & conviction, & letting nothing stop her from the classroom to the courtroom. twitter.com/NPR/status/130…
This resignation waves a huge red flag about political pressure by AG Barr. Nora Dannehy is a career prosecutor well-known to many of us in CT for her professionalism & integrity. To put it bluntly, she would not have resigned without good reason. courant.com/news/connectic…
Bill Barr is a disgrace. As a former Department of Justice employee, I take personal offense to his demeaning comments about the skilled, dedicated public servants who work in our federal justice system. npr.org/2020/09/17/913…
Substance use & mental health disorders don’t discriminate. We need to #EndTheStigma surrounding mental health. These diseases affect us all, which is why we must work together to support people who are struggling & those in recovery. I’m proud to support National #RecoveryMonth.
The #JusticeInPolicing Act would help ensure that all Americans, regardless of race, are treated fairly by the police. McConnell has let this legislation languish on his desk for months. Stop wasting time & bring this measure to the Senate floor for a vote. pic.twitter.com/ebOvHtGUfH
A crucial victory for our postal & democratic systems. State AGs—including CT’s @AGWilliamTong—have shown these changes for what they really are, a politically motivated attack to thwart the quick delivery of mailed ballots. washingtonpost.com/politics/feder…
Trump administration secretly withholding money from 9/11 heroes truly is a new disgusting low— & that is saying a lot these days. nydailynews.com/news/politics/…
Wishing you a speedy recovery, Luke. Get well soon.
.@ElizabethWydra is right: “a democratic constitution, however, means little on its own… what makes a constitution work in a democratic society are the people…” In these deeply difficult times, we must recommit to forming a more perfect union. insidesources.com/point-who-can-…
As to the appointment of Ginsburg’s successor, I couldn’t improve on what McConnell said after Scalia’s death: The American people must have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.
FAA certification is not a shield from liability. Boeing’s flaws & faults proved fatal. The victim’s families are right, “No amount of regulation should shield Boeing & other manufacturers from responsibility when airplanes crash & kill innocent people.” reuters.com/article/boeing…
This close to the election, there is no way that the United States Senate can or should act before the voters decide.
You are not alone. If you or a loved one is struggling with a mental health or substance use disorder, know that recovery is possible. Find the resources you need: samhsa.gov/find-treatment or call SAMHSA’s National Helpline, 1-800-662-HELP (4357)
A hysterectomy or forced sterilization performed without informed consent is a horrendous violation of fundamental rights & autonomy. The DHS IG must immediately investigate the reproductive health policies & practices at the ICDC & other facilities. pic.twitter.com/oTIsosw6TS
Mask wearing should be considered a moral & health mandate—our single best method to combat coronavirus. Backed by both common sense & science, the Wear Your Mask Act would enforce this public health imperative in all federal buildings.
Another significant milestone & achievement for Israel & a positive & welcome development for the entire region. nytimes.com/2020/09/11/wor…
AT&T’s ad-driven phone plans threaten to create a race to the bottom, trampling over consumers' expectations & leaving privacy as a right exclusive to the rich. Americans shouldn't have to choose between a basic necessity & their right to privacy. reuters.com/article/us-at-…

Decades-old evacuation standards, poor data collection, & an over-reliance on manufacturers: this report is damning & demands immediate FAA action. Shrinking seat sizes are not only inconvenient, but threaten health & safety. twitter.com/DOTInspectorGe…

From fierce public outcry to amicus briefs like the one I wrote with my congressional colleagues, the calls to protect USPS from partisan politics must be heard, & real, meaningful action taken to roll back these destructive operational changes.

Even with a vaccine, mask wearing will be a vital tool in conquering COVID-19, along with physical distancing & similar public health steps. This measure makes masks more available as well as mandatory, setting a model for all buildings.

#ConstitutionDay is a reminder of the rights & freedoms enshrined in our founding document. I’m proud to cosponsor a bipartisan resolution to designate September as #NationalDemocracyMonth—celebrating the need for active reflection & participation in our system of government.

We must never forget, otherwise history is doomed to repeat itself. The horrors of the Holocaust must be taught & learned from. By becoming law, the Never Again Education Act will help combat this gap in understanding & fight back against anti-Semitism & hate in all forms. twitter.com/guardian/statu…
The Department of Justice deserves better than an Attorney General who celebrates #ConstitutionDay by corrupting our justice system, spewing vile lies about voting, discrediting the Black Lives Matter movement, & comparing public health guidance to slavery.
Unlike Bill Barr, the line prosecutors, investigators, & federal agents I worked beside as US Attorney—&  know still—believe in equal justice under the law. A justice system free from political corruption is clearly not only a foreign concept to Bill Barr, but an anathema.
