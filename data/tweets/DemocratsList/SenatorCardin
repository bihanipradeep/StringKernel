TOMORROW: Join me for a live conversation on the #2020Census with guests, Beth Lynk, Director of @CensusCounts & Gloria Aparicio Blackwell, Director of @UMD_OCE.  

Stream it live at 2 pm on facebook.com/SenatorBenCard… or Youtube.com/SenatorCardin #GetCounted pic.twitter.com/bwMxFUSmVJ
As we honor America's dedicated workers and reflect on the contributions of the Labor Movement, we must continue to stand up and fight for the rights, wages and support workers and their families deserve. #LaborDay

The HEROES Act includes legislation to extend the moratorium for another year and ensure it covers all renters in need of assistance. The American people don’t have time to wait. We must get back to work. #RentReliefNow

The HEROES Act would set aside $25 billion for the U.S. Postal Service. @SenateMajldr must bring the Senate back into session to take up this legislation and protect this fundamental service. #SaveUSPS
I joined my colleagues in calling on @USDA to extend school meal waivers through the 2020-2021 school year.

For many kids, school lunches may be the only regular meals they receive. We must ensure schools have the flexibility they need to feed our students as #COVID19 continues. pic.twitter.com/cIQLbCBFVm
In the Baltimore region, residents and USPS employees are already feeling the effects of mail delays caused by @POTUS sabotage of our postal services.

I'm w/@ChrisVanHollen @RepSarbanes @Mfume4Congress at the Baltimore USPS center to take action against these attacks. #SaveUSPS pic.twitter.com/kKohDRVwRn
Just this month the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report warning of the threat of Russian interference. The evidence is clear and @POTUS & Senate Republicans continue to block bipartisan legislation to secure our elections & protect voters at every turn.
Disrupting #USPS has taken a toll on the services our citizens rely on. Simply postponing cuts until after the election is still unacceptable for Americans waiting on mail-ordered prescriptions, small businesses transactions & rural communities in the corners of our states.
Next Thursday I’ll be live w/Beth Lynk (@CensusCounts) & Gloria Aparicio Blackwell (@UMD_OCE) to discuss how we can all work together to ensure every community can #GetCounted in the #2020Census. 

We'll be answering your questions live. Reply to submit yours before the event. pic.twitter.com/XLGaacGXL9
The admin's failure to update energy efficiency standards for appliances will cost consumers & businesses money while risking an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

I'm calling on the Dept. of @ENERGY to update these common-sense standards immediately. cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press…

An undercount in the #2020Census would mean fewer services for fewer Marylanders. We lose an estimated $1,800 per person who goes uncounted.

I'm working with my colleagues to extend the Census deadline. If you haven’t already filled yours out, visit my2020census.gov today
The GOP's #COVID19 relief bill failed in the Senate because it failed to provide support for the families, small businesses and state & local govts affected by the pandemic. We must work together to pass a bipartisan bill to respond to this national crisis.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press…
The GOP plan fails to address these challenges. We need real relief, not paper-thin proposals that mostly reallocate funds previously designated for #COVID relief.

I've heard from Maryland veterans who fear that the admin's #USPS sabotage will delay the arrival of their medications.

Americans are still living with the consequences of their actions. I'm still fighting to save this lifeline for our citizens. #SaveUSPS

Today, let's honor the brave women who led this historic victory, including the women of color who faced continued barriers to the ballot box after its passage. We must commit to continuing their work and protecting both the right to vote & gender equality for all. #WomensVote100
The words spoken by Dr. King, John Lewis & leaders at the #MarchOnWashington in 1963 are still relevant today. In the face of enduring police brutality & systemic racism in law enforcement those marching in DC today echo their calls for justice & equality. We must stand with them
Far too many have been killed or injured at the hands of police. It's long past time to take action. 

The Senate must finally pass the #JusticeInPolicing Act to end police brutality, hold officers accountable for misconduct & end systemic racism in our nation's law enforcement. pic.twitter.com/rjOwwu8OTY

That's why I'm proud to join my colleagues in cosponsoring @SenDuckworth's resolution honoring the sacrifices of the brave men and women in uniform and their service to our nation.
America's servicemembers, veterans & Gold Star families deserve the highest appreciation for the sacrifices they have made for our freedoms.

We should all be working to honor & respect them and to build & preserve the America they fought to defend. twitter.com/SenDuckworth/s…
The Trump admin continues to push to reopen schools w/o investing resources to keep students and educators safe, w/o a national testing plan that would help our communities combat #COVID19. 

We can't put our kids and teachers at risk – we must continue to fight for their safety.
This year, the first day of school comes with new challenges and new norms. I wish students, educators and parents around Maryland the best as they make the most of virtual and in-person learning through these circumstances this school year. #BackToSchool
The GOP plan fails to address these challenges. We need real relief, not paper-thin proposals that mostly reallocate funds previously designated for #COVID relief.
Since May we’ve been ready for the Senate to consider the #HeroesAct - a package that will help Americans facing evictions and unemployment, and small businesses surviving this crisis.
Happy #LaborDay! Today we celebrate the resilience of the American workforce. This year we're especially grateful for the millions of essential workers who have continued to provide care for our citizens and keep our nation running through the #COVID19 pandemic.

America’s small businesses are already dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now they have been left to deal with the consequences of @POTUS and Postmaster General Dejoy's attacks on @USPS operations. My colleagues and I are demanding answers. pic.twitter.com/iRPrtyIyMe
And for AG Barr to question the legality of absentee voting is incredulous. @POTUS mails in his ballot. Many states have been doing this for years. This isn't new. Well, except for the part of the president & AG trying to delegitimize an American election.
cnn.com/videos/politic…
Encouraging voters to break the law by voting 2x, while simultaneously talking down legit absentee voting, is a new low for @POTUS. Whatever happened to his oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the USA? Allowing eligible voters to vote is the right thing to do.

When Gov. Hogan walked away from hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for the Red Line, he promised to invest more heavily in bus lines. Today’s move to cut MTA funding breaks that promise.

It's September 1st and rent is due for millions of Americans who can't afford to pay it. 

Without an eviction moratorium, too many families in Maryland & across the nation will be uprooted with no income to find housing. Congress must extend the moratorium & pass #RentReliefNow
Just this month the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report warning of the threat of Russian interference. The evidence is clear and @POTUS & Senate Republicans continue to block bipartisan legislation to secure our elections & protect voters at every turn.
We know foreign interference poses a threat to our upcoming elections yet the Trump admin is choosing to keep Congress and the public in the dark. Right now we need more transparency and targeted action to safeguard our democracy.
