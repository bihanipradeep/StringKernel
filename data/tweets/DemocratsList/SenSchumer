The time has come to decriminalize marijuana in this country.
The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.
Tonight, we mourn the passing of a giant in American history, a champion for justice, a trailblazer for women.

She would want us all to fight as hard as we can to preserve her legacy.
Student debt is holding back entire generations of young adults from buying homes, saving for retirement, starting families, and more.

@SenWarren and I have a plan for the next president to immediately #CancelStudentDebt.
Senator McConnell: Bring the #JusticeInPolicing Act to the Senate floor immediately. Enough is enough. It passed the House more than 2 months ago.
It's September 17th, and President Trump still doesn’t have an adequate national testing strategy.
Nothing is more fundamental to democracy than the integrity of our elections

Conspiracy theories can't be allowed to undermine confidence in our election

@SenSanders & I are fighting to establish a special Senate committee to guarantee election integrity
cnn.com/2020/09/16/pol…
Senator McConnell has said he will never bring any marijuana bill to the floor of the Senate.

Here’s what I told @Leafly:

If Democrats retake the majority in the Senate, I am going to do everything I can to put the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act on the floor.
“I am fervently committed to getting this done.”

That’s what I told @Leafly.

Check out my interview with them on why I'm fighting for the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act to end federal prohibition and address much-needed criminal justice reforms.
Those who swear an oath to protect and serve must face accountability and consequences for misconduct.

It is past time for the Senate to pass the #JusticeInPolicing Act.
Of the many lies Trump has told about COVID:

Telling Bob Woodward “nothing more could have been done” is one of the most galling.

He still does not have an adequate national testing strategy or an adequate national plan for contact tracing.

He never fully invoked the DPA.
The show must go on.

But on stages across Broadway, across New York, and across the country so many are out of work.

We're fighting hard for the #SaveOurStages Act to keep the stages alive and the stories told. pic.twitter.com/iiUmpTXRVP
This is a big victory for communities across America.

Everyone must be counted.

President Trump’s attempt to target immigrants and weaponize the census for political gain is illegal.

nytimes.com/2020/09/10/us/…
There are far too many racial disparities in our criminal justice system.

We must keep fighting for change.

If Democrats retake the Senate, I am going to do EVERYTHING I can to end the federal prohibition on marijuana and undo harms of the War on Drugs.

This shouldn’t be hard.

We are fighting for money to pay teachers, transit workers, and firefighters.

There is a pandemic going on, and they need our help.

But you and Senate Republicans are blocking it. twitter.com/realDonaldTrum…

@SenWarren and I today introduced a Senate resolution with a plan for the next president to immediately #CancelStudentDebt.

The proof of the urgency of the climate crisis is literally in the air around us:

Wildfires are rampaging across the West.

The THRIVE Agenda we launched this week to fight climate change and injustice cannot come soon enough. #TimeToTHRIVE
cbsnews.com/news/climate-c…
Like President Trump, Senate Republicans don't seem to take the threat of climate change seriously.

This is about preserving a habitable planet for our kids and grandkids.
 
Democrats will not stop fighting to act on climate change NOW.
President Trump and Secretary DeVos have been taking us backwards in the fight to relieve student debt.

That's why @SenWarren and I have a plan for the next president to immediately #CancelStudentDebt.

Happy #RoshHashanah to the Jewish community in New York, across the country, and around the world. To a healthy and sweet New Year. Shana Tova!
Today is #NationalBlackVoterDay.

We are fighting to end systemic racism.

And we must reverse Republican efforts to make it harder for Black Americans to vote.

@SenWarren and I have a plan for the next president to immediately #CancelStudentDebt.
The fight to #CancelStudentDebt is critically important to communities of color.

They have been hit hardest by consequences of COVID.

And they disproportionately bear the burden of student debt.

This will help close the racial wealth gap that has persisted for far too long.

In 2020, with so many Americans having died from COVID, his reaction is: “It is what it is”

In 2016, Donald Trump painted a false portrait of a country in crisis and declared “I ALONE CAN FIX IT.”

Four years later, America faces actual crises, and President Trump now says “it is what it is.” Those five words sum up his view of leadership.
America is approaching 200,000 deaths from COVID.

But President Trump said: "If you take the blue states out ... we're really at a low level."

What kind of person dismisses every American who died in a state that didn't support the president politically?

By the end of the week, 200,000 Americans will have died from COVID.

The lives and livelihoods of the American people depend on Republicans abandoning their obsession with doing as little as possible while COVID rages through our nation.
