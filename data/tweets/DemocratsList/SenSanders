If we can afford to give $740 billion to the Pentagon, please don’t tell me we can’t afford to eliminate homelessness in America and cancel the rent during a pandemic. Instead of more bombs and more missiles, we need more jobs, more rent relief and more affordable housing.
$4.7 billion a day.

$32 billion a week.

$141 billion a month.

$845 billion over 6 months.

That's how much 643 billionaires in America made during the pandemic, while 30 million Americans don't have enough food to eat. Yes. It's time for austerity for the billionaire class.
The West Coast is on fire, the color of the sky turned red, the air in many parts of the U.S. is dangerous to breathe, there are 5 simultaneous tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, an 800-mile derecho destroyed Iowa towns. And yet they ask: How can we afford the Green New Deal?
A half million people in Oregon evacuate as wildfires rage. Over 3 million acres in California burned. The western sky is red. An 800-mile derecho destroyed towns in Iowa. The Arctic topped 100 degrees. 

The Green New Deal has been called "expensive." 

Compared to what?
What would it mean for you to get a bank account, a small loan, a debit card or check cashing—all at your local post office?

At 2:30PM ET, @SenGillibrand and I will discuss our Postal Banking Act to provide all Americans with basic banking services. Ask us your questions below.
Make no mistake about it. The Green New Deal is far less expensive than losing our planet to the greed of the fossil fuel industry.

Medicare for All is far less expensive than the status quo that leaves 92 million uninsured or under-insured.

The fight for justice goes on.
Unfortunately, Sen. McConnell has decided to go against Justice Ginsburg's dying wishes and is cementing a shameful legacy of brazen hypocrisy.

The right thing to do here is clear, and Senate Republicans know it. We should let voters decide. Period. pic.twitter.com/VI5O6RCnpg
Every week during the pandemic:

643 billionaires became $32 billion richer.

The total income of the bottom 82% of workers went down by $3.7 million - combined.

Our job: Tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires made during the pandemic and expand Medicare to all.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was one of the great justices in modern American history and her passing is a tremendous loss to our country. She will be remembered as an extraordinary champion of justice and equal rights.
We must reassure the American people that vote-by-mail is safe, every ballot will be counted, and our election will be free and fair.

@SenSchumer and I are calling on Sen. McConnell to act in a bipartisan way to restore public confidence in our democracy. cnn.com/2020/09/16/pol…
We cannot stand by as conspiracy theories about mail-in ballots and disinformation about Election Day results undermine public trust in the voting process.

Wealth and income inequality is now so extreme that the top 1% is literally taking $2.5 trillion away from the bottom 90% each and every year. It's time to end trickle-down economics, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and create an economy that works for all, not just the 1%.
Amount of federal government subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry every year: $15 billion.

The amount it should be, immediately: $0.

It's time to end fossil fuel subsidies and enact the Green New Deal. npr.org/2020/09/11/897…

While big banks and large corporations are able to borrow money for virtually no interest, it is absolutely unacceptable that low-income Americans are being charged 400% interest on a $375 payday loan.

At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, not only do we need to repeal all of the Trump tax breaks for the top 1% and large corporations, we need to tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires have made during the pandemic and expand Medicare to all.
Today we remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and the brave people who risked their lives to help that day. Those selfless acts of sacrifice show the very best of us as a nation, and we can honor that sacrifice by working to build a world of security and dignity for all.
30 million Americans don't have enough food to eat.

40 million tenants are struggling to pay the rent.

150 million Americans face serious financial problems.

And the Republican Senate continues to do nothing except confirm more right wing judges. That is a national disgrace.
