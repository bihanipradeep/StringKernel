We need transparency from Mr. DeJoy and Mr. Barger on the data they used ‚Äì if any at all ‚Äì to make the changes at USPS. 

I'm asking for the minutes of their closed board meetings so we can know the truth. 

We must protect USPS.

Our public lands are under attack from an unconfirmed & unaccountable Director of @BLMNational, Mr. William Perry Pendley.

I opposed John Barger's nomination today because, as a member of the Postal Board of Governors, he played a key role in appointing Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General, whose operational changes have resulted in mail delays nationwide. pic.twitter.com/0kl0VZZDeU
üì∫ Shortly, I‚Äôll be taking to the Senate floor at 7:25pm ET/4:25pm PT to call attention to the historic wildfires raging across our Western states and the need to take immediate action to combat climate change.

I‚Äôm pleased to see @UNevadaReno receive $300,000 to support the needs of tribal ranchers and farmers, while adhering to safety guidelines to prevent the spread of #COVID19.
As a result of these fires, the air quality in some of our communities is so poor and unhealthy that it's exceeding 20 year records.
