As Republicans prepare to gavel into a politically-motivated business meeting today, let's remember that @HSGAC is the Senate's primary oversight committee of all agencies across the federal government. 
 
Not a tool to leverage for political gain.
Today, instead, I will be joining @EPWDems to do what the people of Delaware sent me to Washington to do.
 
I will prioritize the important work the American people need us to be doing now more than ever. 
 
Once again, I would urge my Republican colleagues to do the same.
.@USGAO's report confirms what we’ve heard from too many manufacturers about this administration’s misguided tariffs.

Especially now, the government needs to be providing more certainty for the workers and businesses that drive our economy — not playing favorites. twitter.com/USGAO/status/1…
Here is a reminder of all of the legitimate issues @HSGAC could be addressing during unprecedented health, economic, social justice and climate crises instead of spreading disinformation put forth by a hostile foreign power:

Each and every one of us has a responsibility to help stop the spread of #COVID19.

From our big cities to our small towns, @USPS is there, delivering everything from prescription medications to paychecks and letters.

That's why, for years, I've dedicated myself to fighting to protect and preserve this critical American institution. And I'm not stopping now.
This goes well beyond politics. If there's one thing that should unite Democrats and Republicans it must be protecting our democracy from foreign attacks so that every American can have full confidence in our elections.

Families & businesses in Delaware are already experiencing the consequences of the #ClimateCrisis. In the lowest-lying state in the nation, we can see the effects of climate change every day.

Happy to have the support of my friend & fellow Delawarean @ChrisCoons in this effort. twitter.com/chriscoons/sta…
Together, @SenGaryPeters and I are working to ensure that @USPS is independent and accountable to the public — not partisans — so that it can continue to serve seniors, small businesses, and rural communities across our country. Read about our bill here: carper.senate.gov/public/index.c…
I will do everything I can to hold my Republican colleagues accountable and fight for fairness — the principle to which Ruth Bader Ginsburg dedicated her entire life. twitter.com/RiegerReport/s…
.@realDonaldTrump doesn’t have a health care plan. 

He’s never had a health care plan. 

And he’s working *right now* to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, including the law’s protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. twitter.com/evanmcmurry/st…
My bill with @SenGaryPeters, @Sen_JoeManchin and @amyklobuchar will ensure that @USPS remains nonpartisan so that it can continue to serve as a critical lifeline for seniors, small businesses, and rural communities across America. Read more about it here: carper.senate.gov/public/index.c…
As someone who once had the privilege of running @HSGAC, I am deeply troubled and frustrated that this is what this Committee is being used for and I refuse to be party to this political spectacle, advancing lies and foreign propaganda.
Well, what a surprise, @realDonaldTrump. They are doing it again. And your unwillingness to protect our democracy is disgraceful. twitter.com/thehill/status…
It is with heavy hearts tonight that Martha and I mourn the tremendous loss of Justice Ginsburg. But I know that her legacy will live on, especially in all the women and young girls she inspired throughout her remarkable life. My full statement here: carper.senate.gov/public/index.c…
We know the changes Postmaster General DeJoy rushed to make at @USPS caused harmful delays for millions of Americans. This is unacceptable at any time, but especially during a pandemic. 

These changes must be reversed, and Congress must be consulted before more changes are made. twitter.com/SenGaryPeters/…
My friend and colleague, @SenatorRomney, is right. 
 
Let's be clear: this charade is using @HSGAC's time and resources to pursue political investigations based on conspiracy theories and disinformation, and it must end. twitter.com/npfandos/statu…
The #2020Census will determine where billions of dollars of federal funding goes — from hospitals and emergency services to funding for health and disease studies. 
 
You can help ensure Delaware receives its fair share by filling out your census form at my2020census.gov!
Today, we need to do everything we can to make sure that @USPS is delivering for the American people.
  
The Postal Service must be independent and accountable to the public, not partisans. So my colleagues and I introduced legislation to do just that.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg may have been small in stature, but our nation has lost an absolute giant. Her intellect was unmatched. Her work ethic unrivaled. And her lifelong pursuit of true equality under the law — for women, people of color, LGBTQ Americans, workers — was unparalleled.
NEW: I've joined 40 of my Democratic colleagues in calling on @DHSgov to investigate this whistleblower complaint alleging forced hysterectomies at a Georgia immigration detention center.

These absolutely appalling reports deserve our immediate attention.
