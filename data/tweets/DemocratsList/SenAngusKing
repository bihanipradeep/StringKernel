To all those throughout Maine and across the country who are struggling: you are not alone, even during this most challenging of times. Your neighbors and loved ones stand with you, and we will all get through this – together.

America’s election – the foundation of Democracy itself – is in grave peril as we face disinformation from global adversaries around the planet, and @DNI_Ratcliffe’s move to stop briefing Congress on foreign threats to our election is an outrage. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/dqxKUXI9fA
September is #SuicideAwarenessMonth, which is even more important with the pandemic adding new stress and uncertainty. Please, know that help is available; if you or someone you know is struggling, call 1-800-273-8255 or visit suicidepreventionlifeline.org.

Because we need you here.
Before passing the CARES Act, the Senate voted down Senator McConnell’s partisan proposal – twice – leading to negotiations that secured vital funding for Maine and the nation. 

Today's vote should do the same; the American people are counting on it. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/B0P76RmlrA
The legislation is simple: the families of America’s fallen heroes should be able to visit any national park, across the country, for free. It’s a small show of our recognition for those whose loved ones gave so much for our security; one we can and should make immediately.
The coronavirus pandemic has created new challenges for Americans in recovery – drastically altered routines, increased social isolation, reduced access to treatment and support systems, on and on. In the face of these new stresses, we all must step up to provide support.
Yesterday’s decision by @DNI_Ratcliffe was a step backwards. Congressional briefings are how we give American people the real-time information they need on election interference. These briefings must happen regularly – sending Congress a written statement simply doesn't cut it. pic.twitter.com/bXXENjtGCT
Digital connectivity is a lifeline to folks in rural areas, particularly seniors who rely on telehealth services to safely receive care during the pandemic. Today I thanked the National Digital Equity Center and @CharterGov for their roles in expanding broadband across our state. pic.twitter.com/UXwejuVG9D
In the face of partisan divides and national crises, organizations like the Houlton Rotary Club exemplify the Maine approach to challenges: bring people together to find solutions that improve your community. Grateful for their time yesterday, and their service to Northern Maine. pic.twitter.com/5beJSdzUHB
I’ll be joining @JohnBerman on @NewDay at ~7:15 — hope you can tune in.
HEADS UP: In ~15 minutes I’ll be joining @MaineCalling to discuss the President’s unconstitutional executive orders, which will fail to address the struggles facing Americans. LISTEN HERE: mainepublic.org
In the midst of one the most serious economic and health crises in a century, the President is attempting to use powers he doesn’t have to push a relief plan that won’t work. My full statement on his unconstitutional executive orders: king.senate.gov/newsroom/press…
Mark Twain once said that history doesn’t always repeat itself but it often rhymes, especially for those who refuse to learn its lessons. We must learn from our past in order to prepare for these ongoing efforts to undermine our democracy – this November and in the years ahead.
At 1 p.m., I’m joining @RepGallagher and @BudgetHawks for a conversation on the need for a 21st century cyberdefense posture for the nation. Details: twitter.com/BudgetHawks/st…
This report serves as a rear-view mirror but also a possible view of the road ahead of us as we enter another election cycle. The fact is that the findings of the committee – supported on a bipartisan basis – matter more at this moment in time than ever before.
Gold Star Families have made immense sacrifices for our nation, and they deserve our eternal support in every way imaginable. Today, I urged passage of my legislation to ensure these families have free access to our nation’s greatest natural treasures. pic.twitter.com/pPwlByoKJV
As students, families, and teachers adjust to the new normal of remote schooling, it is vital that resources exist to support the mental health of our children. That’s why this week, @SenBlumenthal and I introduced the Social-Emotional Learning for Families Act.
With less than fifty days until the upcoming election – and with an anxious, divided America watching – Senator McConnell should honor the life and legacy of this icon by respecting her final wish that a successor should not be considered until the election has been decided.
When we talk about preparing our students for success, it can’t just be about teaching them state capitals and multiplication tables – it’s also about fundamental life and social skills. This bill will help ensure students are gaining the tools they need for long-term success.

This was an abject failure of leadership, and the full extent of this failure grows more clear with each passing day and each new death. Infuriating, and heartbreaking.
The President argued that he was “downplaying” this crisis to prevent panic, which makes no sense at all. We don’t consider hurricane warnings to be “causing panic” – because it’s the role of the government to inform us, so we can make decisions based on the threats we face.
It’s right there on the tapes. President Trump knew the scope and scale of the coronavirus pandemic before it struck. He could have warned the American people; could have changed behaviors and told people to take this seriously; could have slowed the virus’s spread. 

He didn’t.
Jesse Harvey was a tireless advocate for Maine people struggling with substance use disorders. His loss is a tragic and painful reminder of the work we must do to confront this awful epidemic, especially during the pandemic. bangordailynews.com/2020/09/09/new…
The Senate Majority Leader’s refusal to act with urgency is creating real pain for real people; it’s time for him to step up after months of delay, and truly engage in good-faith negotiations, so Congress can provide relief to Americans in need.
The CDC’s eviction ban is a step in the right direction – but it’s far from a full solution. We need to extend these protections through the end of the public health crisis, and provide relief for both tenants and small landlords. pressherald.com/2020/09/08/nat…

Because we need you here.
We also must not forget the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own – the result of a pandemic that has shut down industries, and a toothless federal response that has failed to meet this crisis. The Senate must provide support for them, ASAP.
This pandemic has highlighted the critical contributions of America’s workforce, which is why on #LaborDay, we must honor our essential workers who continue to put themselves in harm’s way each and every day to keep our nation running.
As we enter the holiday weekend, please remember this pandemic does not take days off. Be smart, be safe, and wear a mask — for yourselves, and for your community.
Big step to better serve those who served our nation: after extensive advocacy from Maine's Congressional delegation, next year the VA will break ground on a residential treatment facility to support Maine veterans struggling with substance use disorders. wmtw.com/article/maine-…
This Administration’s foolish, dangerous abandonment of American leadership continues to weaken our fight against this pandemic. Why on earth would the nation with the most coronavirus deaths not want to participate in global vaccine research?! npr.org/sections/coron…
With the election approaching, @DNI_Ratcliffe should be helping to inform voters about foreign attempts to interfere in American democracy. Instead, he’s creating additional uncertainty. What an awful dereliction of his duty to the American public. bangordailynews.com/2020/09/01/opi…
TUNE IN: At ~4:30 p.m. I’ll be speaking with @NicolleDWallace about the Administration’s decision to stop briefing Congress on election interference as American voters are making their choices — an enormous step backwards.
I'm thrilled @UMaine has received a significant investment to bolster their Arctic environmental studies program to benefit over 50 graduate students. These students represent future leaders and innovators, and we need them now more than ever. bangordailynews.com/2020/08/29/new…

It’s vital that we prioritize funding to those who are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus. I’m thrilled to announce that 93 nursing homes throughout our state are receiving $10.4M to increase testing and availability of PPE to protect our loved ones. wabi.tv/2020/08/28/93-…
