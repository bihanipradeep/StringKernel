What kind of republican briefs congress and tells the truth
Chris Wray’s not loyal to Dear Leader.
Why does he want a free-and-fair election?
Stand down Chris Wray!

If we had a legitimate, independent AG and DOJ representing the interests of the U.S.A. then by golly, they’d be looking into those altered CDC reports right now. Sadly, we don’t and they aren’t.

How are you Doods? I miss you.
Hope so. I’ll believe it when I see it.
No momentum; #JOEMENTUM!
The “fiscally conservative” thing was ALWAYS a lie. 
As was patriotism, pro-life, family values, support for troops, small gov’t, etc...

The GOP almost always skyrocket the debt and throw us into a recession. Democrats are elected; they fix the economy.

I wonder if that insane Russian proposal is on Trump’s reform plan.
Ew. Not sure I want to be involved in that.
😂🤣 I can relate!
My husband has been cutting my hair. I’m looking forward to an upgrade, some day.
We can see the pain. He hurts. He has feelings but, only for himself. Sad.
I probably wouldn’t have believed that good “something in the air” yesterday. Haven’t felt ANY optimism in a while —and that STUPID racist #4thofJuly speech made me feel worse.

But today, SCOTUS upheld the Rule of Law when the Senate wouldn’t — and TRE45ON loses. America wins. pic.twitter.com/Ia0x9DFiMW
Yeah. Chris Wray’s not even a felon.
He’s not even a Nazi; he’s antifa.
Get him outa here!
Punch him in the face.

Thank you.
Yes. 
Hell yes!
Yeah, if Bolton’s going to write-in some RW kook who can’t win, he’s voting for Trump.  Bolton is clearly incapable of making a rational decision.  What a loser.

Whenever Trump insults journalists for asking difficult questions, it’s a reflection on him, not the journalist.
If Trump can’t handle the pressure of accountability, he ought to resign and let someone less sensitive step in and actually do the job.
#TrumpPresser
I didn’t hear anyone ask the denier in chief why he’s demanding Congress NOT FUND testing or contact tracing in the next relief bill!

Why didn’t they make him tell us why he won’t allow America to isolate the disease and stop the spread, like the rest of the world?
#TrumpPresser
I’m furious! For the last 4 mos Trump  cheered on the anti-mask protestors. Encouraged them to arm themselves and harass their governors who attempted to mitigate the spread and keep communities safe.

Today he says wear a mask?
Over 140,000 are dead Trump!!

#TrumpPresser
Stop 🛑 @MSNBC!
Are we really supposed to credit Trump for saying coronavirus is serious? He’s been lying about the severity from Day-1, while over 140,000 American’s died!
He’s not a child; he’s supposed to be the Commander in Chief!
Thanks for nothing LIAR @POTUS!
#TrumpPresser
I knew it was. That’s why the con man began running for re-election the day after his inauguration.
How are you Doods? I miss you.
Nobody cares what TRE45ON thinks about John Lewis.
He’s the Grand Wizard of the Confederacy.  He’ll be jealous of the love or respect Rep. Lewis earned in his life.

I read your article a day late, while knowing that we got that good “democracy” and “rule of law” news today, proving your premonition WAS RIGHT ON 🎯. 

There was definitely “something in the air …something good...”

My husband has been cutting my hair. I’m looking forward to an upgrade, some day.
That’s my understanding too. Hallelujah!  It’s a good day.
Of course that’s not true. But the word “exposed” bothers me here.
