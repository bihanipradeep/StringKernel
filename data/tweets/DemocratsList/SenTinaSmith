We need our mail. We also need answers. pic.twitter.com/8ZhhLA1fBf
The Trump Administration wants to dismantle the @USPS. Millions of Americans depend on the Postal Service every day. We need to build it up, not tear it down. I'll keep fighting to #SaveThePostOffice.

I’m a member of the Special Committee on the Climate Crisis. Today, we released our final report. It’s based on a year of discussions and inputs from voices all over the country, including multiple Minnesotans. pic.twitter.com/dwfzLvKEnB
Our world is moving toward a more sustainable future, and the US can either lead or follow. I think we should lead. Check out our report here: democrats.senate.gov/climate-report
My bill, the COVID-19 Treatment Coverage Act, will help protect Americans from COVID-19 expenses so that they can get the eventual vaccine without worrying about how they are going to afford it. Learn more:  smith.senate.gov/sen-smith-intr…
@SenKamalaHarris has an important bill that would expunge marijuana convictions and address many other important criminal justice reforms. I encourage you to read more about it here. 

I’m cosponsoring it. harris.senate.gov/news/press-rel…
Starting today, landlords can evict millions of families that were protected by the #CARESAct. I'm on a bill to stop this from happening but McConnell refuses to give it a vote.

Mr. Majority Leader, ball is in your court. Let’s take a vote and give people the relief they need.
Ultimately, Americans support legalization, but the federal government hasn’t kept up. Legalizing marijuana in a smart, practical way benefits everyone. You can read even more details about my bill here: smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tin…
Broadband is the infrastructure of the 21st century. It's a necessity for every student in Minnesota. I'm calling on @FCC to boost a program to help close the divide between students who have fast, reliable internet access and those who don’t. belleplaineherald.com/news/klobuchar…
We can do both, and I'll keep fighting to make sure we do.

This is important because 5 million+ have lost health insurance due to the economic crisis caused by COVID-19. Also, remember that taxpayer $ is already being invested into developing COVID-19 vaccines & treatments. You shouldn’t have to pay—essentially twice—for your vaccine.
It’s August 27 and the Administration still doesn’t have a strong testing strategy. So @SenWarren and I are taking action by pressing for information on testing inventory and result turnaround time. cnbc.com/2020/08/27/sen…
Parents raising kids during this pandemic are running into a major problem--our childcare system is at risk of collapsing. We've got two options, we can fix this crisis or ignore it. 

I teamed up with @SenWarren to make a plan to fix it. I want to share it with you. [THREAD]
Peace be with Congressman Rick Nolan, Mary and all your family as you mourn the loss of beautiful Katherine to lung cancer.
Furthermore, climate change poses a direct threat to the health and safety of our service members. By taking climate action now, we can keep our troops safe. Plus, reducing the military’s dependence on fossil fuels will lead to more resilient, sustainable bases.
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter told us how local governments are leading the fight against climate change, and MN environmental justice leader Dr. Cecilia Martinez told us about the importance of a climate plan that prioritizes the health of all Americans.
We can do our part to make sure that our EMS providers are able to recruit the best volunteers to help with first response. 
 
Just signed onto a bipartisan bill that does just that. We owe it to the heroes who put their lives on the line every single day.
Americans depend on @USPS for everything from everyday mail to life-saving medications. We should be able to come together across party lines to resolve this. Funding the Postal Service has never been—and should never be—a political issue.kvrr.com/2020/08/28/sen…

I just keep thinking—Trump had information that would have literally saved people’s lives, and lied about it. He played it down, he said it would just disappear. 

That’s who he is. It’s not who we are, though.
I’ve got several bills tackling this problem head on. 
 
The choice between economic growth and curbing emissions has always been a false one. We can create new jobs, help our economy, and get our country running on clean energy. Really that simple.
Agreed.
 
If we don’t pass serious legislation to get our emissions down, we risk accelerating environmental catastrophe. twitter.com/SenKamalaHarri…

I'll close by saying that this pandemic only exacerbated the childcare crisis. I've been working on this issue my entire time in the Senate—the way we do childcare in this country needs an overhaul.

So let's make sure childcare survives this crisis AND fix the system long-term.
This isn't just the right thing to do, it's also an investment. Working moms contribute a huge amount to our workforce, if communities lack childcare, we are risking hamstringing our economic recovery.
With more emergency funding, we can avert this crisis. We can allow providers to keep staff on payroll, get PPE, and get assistance for other expenses needed to make childcare work.

Our bill has 50 billion in funding for this effect.
I'll touch on number two in this thread. Mass closures are a serious issue. Childcare has always had thin margins and an early survey indicated nearly half of all providers could not survive a two week shutdown.
Our plan has three pieces.  

1) Providing support to providers caring for the children of those fighting this pandemic on the frontlines. 
2) Preventing mass permanent closures in the childcare system.
3) Shoring up the system to make it work better in the future.
Also want to point out this crisis has been particularly hard on working moms. The @NYTimes had a feature on this recently, linked it here. 

So what can we do to ensure we have a robust childcare system in place when we can return to normal? nytimes.com/2020/07/02/ins…
Before I start, I'll just say this issue is personal. Both @SenWarren and I were young moms, our kids were always our first priority. 

When you’re a working mom, you need to feel confident that your kids are safe and cared for.

My bill also establishes a national strategy to combat the use and abuse of cannabis by youth, and requires that civil rights advocates get input in the decision making process. This must be at the forefront of our efforts to legalize marijuana.

I also want to talk about promoting equity in our drug policy, something that our country has failed to do with the War on Drugs .
This is just common sense and the FDA already does this for tobacco—it should be extended to marijuana.
That means things like consumers being able to see full ingredient disclosures, products being checked for any defects, and regulations on usage of pesticides (among other things).
Because marijuana is prohibited at the federal level, there are no quality control guidelines. That’s bad for everyone. 

My bill requires these guidelines be put in place.
