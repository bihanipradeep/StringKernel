Four years ago Senator McConnell demanded that Supreme Court vacancies go unfilled during a presidential election year. Now he’s completely reversed himself because it’s to his political advantage. Do Senate Rs still believe that the voices of the American people should be heard? pic.twitter.com/3cDPolcPnT
Senate Judiciary Dems are making ourselves clear: there cannot be one set of rules for a Republican President and one set for a Democratic President. This vacancy should not be filled until after the inauguration. twitter.com/senfeinstein/s…
If four Republican Senators commit not to vote to fill this Supreme Court vacancy until after the presidential inauguration, then the voices of the American people will have a chance to be heard.
Remember Senator McConnell’s demand that SCOTUS vacancies go unfilled during a presidential election year, which was also Justice Ginsburg’s dying wish. McConnell pleaded with us to let the voters have the last word. Every Senator should be asked to commit to the McConnell Rule.
.@SenWhitehouse, @maziehirono, & I called for this investigation last month to shed light on the Trump Admin's mismanagement of immigration courts.
 
We must hold the Admin accountable for the troubling politicization of our immigration system. twitter.com/jacq_thomsen/s…
The Supreme Court’s most valiant lady is gone. Rest in peace, Ruth.
Honored to virtually receive the @TheToyAssoc "Champion of Play" award yesterday. We must combat the online sales of stolen or dangerous consumer products, increase marketplace transparency, & ensure that only safe toys make it into the hands of our children.
Last night, President Trump claimed that a #COVID19 vaccine approval is just a few weeks away. He also claims to have a replacement plan for the ACA ready.
 
Today I asked senior Trump Admin. officials from CDC & HHS if they could back up these claims. They could not. pic.twitter.com/vYdwyA7HPu
Today, Dept. of Ed published its call for proposals for FY20 Open Textbooks Pilot grants, a program I've championed. This program will help make college textbooks more affordable. I encourage interested institutions in IL & across the U.S. to apply. grants.gov/web/grants/vie…
The 2020 census count closes on September 30th and it is extremely important that every Illinoisans does their part to #MakeILCount.

There must be an immediate independent investigation of these horrific allegations. If true, these are grave offenses and the perpetrators must be held accountable for violating the dignity and human rights of the victims. cnn.com/2020/09/15/pol…
The #COVID19 pandemic has bruised every part of the American economy, including hog producers. I spoke today with @ilpork about the urgent needs in America's heartland & delivering the support our rural areas desperately need.
President Trump is trying to rescind TPS from hundreds of thousands of immigrants with deep roots in our country – including 130,000 essential workers – so he can deport them.
 
The Senate must immediately pass Dream & Promise Act to give these TPS holders a path to citizenship. pic.twitter.com/Wx1yoVrsTl
The Trump Admin's anti-immigrant policies endanger refugees & asylum seekers fleeing violence and repression. I am joining my colleagues in calling for an end to these policies so that the U.S. can reassume our role as a beacon of freedom & hope for the world. pic.twitter.com/LDtidvM54F
The President is asking SCOTUS to repeal pre-existing condition protections & health coverage for millions in the MIDDLE of a pandemic. And there is still no secret Trump plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. Just more hollow campaign promises.

Last week, Pres. Trump unveiled his latest shortlist for the Supreme Court.
 
I’m joining @SenWhitehouse and others in asking if federal conflict-of-interest and transparency laws were followed in the making of this list, especially to the extent dark money groups were involved. twitter.com/SenWhitehouse/…
More than 1,000 former ITT Tech students in Illinois will receive $9.4 million in student debt relief as part of @ILAttyGeneral settlement with private lending program operator, PEAKS Trust. Long overdue relief for these student borrowers. twitter.com/ILAttyGeneral/…
This afternoon, I’ll be going to the Senate floor with @SenatorMenendez and @ChrisVanHollen trying to pass legislation to protect Venezuelans in the U.S. Make sure you tune in at 2:45 pm ET. twitter.com/AmericasVoice/…

Senator McConnell’s refusal to pass a relief bill that includes desperately needed funding for state and local governments threatens the livelihoods of our teachers, EMTs, and firefighters. Will he ever feel the urgency to help struggling Americans in IL and across the country?
