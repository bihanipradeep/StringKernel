The climate crisis is an existential threat and a fundamental challenge of our time. RT if you agree.
This isn’t up for debate: confronting the climate crisis that’s banging on our doorstep must be grounded in science.
Millions are out of work, hungry, and suffering as the United States has surpassed 194,000 coronavirus deaths. The American people desperately need meaningful action from Congress.
If you don’t already have a plan in the event of a wildfire evacuation order, then do it now. Pack a bag, gather medicine and important documents, think about your pets and old photos you can’t replace.

Permanently etched into our memories from September 11th are images of our country under attack. Not our ships or military bases, but our people. Our neighbors. Our families.

And also in our memories are people from all walks of life—united in our resolve to help one another.
There’s less than two weeks left to complete the Census, and I cannot say this enough: it’s so important that everyone participates. The Census will directly impact the resources that your community receives for the next decade. Do your part and visit 2020Census.gov.
With increased droughts, unpredictable rains, higher heat, drier air and extreme winds, climate change is priming California and the West for devastating wildfires.

We have to get real about this: it's going to take a bold fight against climate change to change course.
Months after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, the administration is still in court trying to overturn the Affordable Care Act and strip away health insurance from millions of Americans.
For me, Hispanic Heritage Month is a reminder of how proud I am to represent a state as richly diverse as California. Our state has been immensely shaped by the achievements and contributions of the Hispanic community and we are better for it.
The historic wildfire season in the West and record-breaking hurricane season in the Atlantic are not a coincidence. This is climate change.
The wildfires have severely impacted air quality in California and across the West Coast. We can’t overlook how serious this is during an ongoing public health crisis. Take steps to protect yourself—and check in on loved ones and neighbors. fresnobee.com/news/californi…
Last year, I Introduced the Wildfire Defense Act to help communities plan for and defend themselves against devastating wildfires. As we're witnessing the worst wildfire season in California history, it's clear that Congress must pass my bill—immediately.
Californians, let’s remember one important thing during this wildfire season and ongoing pandemic: we are a resilient state and we must continue looking out for one another. If you have extra water or food, drive to a local shelter and drop it off. Anything helps.
September 11th is a somber day of reflection for our nation. A day when we remember the lives lost, the families torn apart, and the heroes who ran toward danger to help people they never knew. Their actions on that day remind us that there is nothing we cannot overcome.

The wildfires raging in California and across the West are unprecedented and demand more support from the federal government. That’s why today I’m joining Senator @RonWyden in calling on Congress to provide critical funds to help our states get through this wildfire season.
Across government, music, academia and more, Afro-Latinos have made such rich contributions to the fabric of our nation. It's so important that we recognize their achievements, not just during Hispanic Heritage Month but every month. 21ninety.com/were-celebrati…
My Wildfire Defense Act would provide $1 billion a year for cities and towns to plan for and defend themselves against wildfires. It's about giving communities the resources they need to build resilience, instead of leaving them on their own.

Congress must pass my bill.
More than 3 million acres have burned in California so far this year. At least 24 lives have been lost due to the wildfires and more than 4,200 structures destroyed. Over 43,000 people are currently evacuated.

We will get through this together, one day and one step at a time.
There's no question that wildfire smoke can be harmful to your health. And it's especially important that pregnant women stay safe as air quality continues to be severely impacted in California and across the West. whattoexpect.com/news/family/wi…
