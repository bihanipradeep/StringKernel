My thoughts are with those on the Gulf Coast, as they prepare for #HurricaneSally. When past hurricanes brought massive floods, we witnessed the NFIP fail Americans in their greatest hour of need.

It‚Äôs time to reform our national flood insurance program. usatoday.com/story/news/nat‚Ä¶
I was the first in my family to go to college and proudly graduated from @saintpetersuniv, a #HispanicServingInstitution.

HSI‚Äôs have empowered millions of Latinos like me to get an education and achieve their dreams. #HSIWeek
Hey Amy, sorry to hear this. You can reach out to Jeremy in my office at Jeremy_Julis@menendez.senate.gov. He can help.
‚¨ÜÔ∏è diversity = ‚¨ÜÔ∏è $.

It‚Äôs simple: Diversity helps the corporate bottom line.

A recent @BCG study found companies that increase diversity within their leadership ranks have ‚Äúmore & better innovation & improved financial performance.‚Äù
With @SenBillCassidy & my National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization & Reform Act, we can make the program more sustainable & affordable, hold @FEMA and private contractors accountable & invest in mitigation that reduces risk and prevents costly flooding in the first place.
Damning report by @blakeellis3 & @melhicken.

@Amazon must immediately stop the sale of dangerous and defective AmazonBasics products, recall them, and effectively and immediately notify consumers of potential risks. cnn.com/2020/09/10/bus‚Ä¶

Come on. NRA & NRA Foundation execs are facing a slew of allegations/lawsuits for lavishly spending "charity" $ on themselves, yet they‚Äôre still eligible to solicit & take donations from our federal employees? That‚Äôs rich. thehill.com/homenews/senat‚Ä¶
Diversity shouldn't be a buzzword, but a deliverable.

This new study by @uwsgeezer proves corporations need to be held accountable for diversity, instead of empty promises.

My Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act would do just that. nytimes.com/2020/09/15/bus‚Ä¶
What this says about our education system is just as troubling, because if we don‚Äôt learn from history‚Äîif future generations don‚Äôt know and understand history‚Äîwe are doomed to repeat it. #NeverAgain nbcnews.com/news/world/sur‚Ä¶
New @claimscon survey is beyond concerning. 6 million Jews & 5 million others were brutally murdered by the Nazi regime.

That's a fact. There's #NoDenyingIt.

Antisemitism is not dead, but all too easily awoken. Anti-Jewish hatred is dangerous & we must condemn it in all forms. twitter.com/USATODAY/statu‚Ä¶
