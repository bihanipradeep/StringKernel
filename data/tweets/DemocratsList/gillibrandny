I was proud to join @NewYorkStateAG, @RepJerryNadler and @galeabrewer to encourage every New Yorker to fill out the 2020 census. We can take a stand for our communities here in NY by being counted.

I am fighting alongside @SenSchumer to make sure New York's public transit riders aren't left out of the new federal relief bill. We need at least $32 billion to keep the essential workers behind New York's reopening and recovery safely moving on trains and buses. #RescueRiders
It’s simple: Congress needs to extend the $600 federal unemployment insurance benefit.
 
Working families need this relief. There’s no time to wait, @senatemajldr. pic.twitter.com/yj2O3kC7Xx
Many families on Staten Island and across New York are struggling to keep food on the table. Today, I joined @RepMaxRose for a visit to the CYO Community Services Center, which is working to help fight hunger in our communities. pic.twitter.com/I72uHjSH4F
I’m joining veterans, advocates, @RepRaulRuizMD, Jon Stewart, and John Feal to introduce the #WarFightersBill to get our heroes—who are suffering from toxic exposure—the benefits and care they deserve. Watch live: twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1…
I’m joining @SenSanders to announce The Postal Banking Act with a live discussion and Q&A tomorrow (9/17) at 2:30PM ET.
 
We'll talk about how our bill can end predatory lending and help millions of underbanked Americans.

My heart breaks at the news of last night’s mass shooting in Rochester. I send my deepest condolences to the loved ones of those killed, and thinking of those who were hurt.
 
We are failing our communities—we have to do more to end gun violence.
