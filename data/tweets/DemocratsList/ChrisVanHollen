Glad to see the @Ravens weighing in to support the George Floyd #JusticeinPolicing Act! They point out to Sen. McConnell that “you alone have the ability to act now” and “we implore you to allow the will of the Senate to work...by scheduling a floor vote.” Amen! pic.twitter.com/S9Nd4JJzbs
We just heard back from the Chief Actuary at the Social Security Administration: As @SenSchumer, @RonWyden, @SenSanders, and I suspected, if Trump goes through with his reckless plan, it would “permanently deplete” the funds that keep Social Security up and running. pic.twitter.com/IaMrxfRKUa
Instead of containing the virus, Trump is trying to manipulate the Postal Service to cheat in the election. As I said outside the Baltimore USPS Center today with postal workers, union leaders, and other public officials, we must act to end this abuse of power. #SaveThePostOffice pic.twitter.com/aWzb0pM3aD
Many TPS workers, all here legally, are on the front lines of our COVID-19 response. Today @SenatorCardin, @SenFeinstein, and I urged the Senate to protect them. This ruling makes it even more urgent to shield them from Trump’s inhumane deportation orders. twitter.com/joshgerstein/s…
It has been almost 80 days since the House passed the #JusticeInPolicing Act. Senate Republicans may think it’s fine to pause on delivering justice, but the majority of this country does not. Justice delayed is justice denied. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/BXALLlMEJY
Postmaster DeJoy got caught red-handed, but simply suspending further changes isn't enough. He and Trump need to end the war on our mail and postal workers. If they don't, Congress and the courts will. #DontMessWithUSPS pic.twitter.com/K8XCB3ertC
We know Trump and McConnell will put their interest over what’s good for the country, but at this grave moment for our country we need at least 4 GOP senators to commit to waiting to act on the Court until after Inauguration Day and seating of a new Congress.
Starting soon: my Telephone Town Hall with Dr. Harolyn Belcher. We’ll provide an update on COVID-19 and take questions you might have. I hope you can join us!

Tune in live at 6:45 PM here: vanhollen.senate.gov/live
With reports that the Postmaster General is removing mail sorting machines from facilities around the country and Trump admitting that he’s intentionally withholding money from USPS to sabotage the election, Congress needs to act fast. #DontMessWithUSPS vice.com/en_us/article/…
As many Maryland families continue to struggle with the economic hardship caused by the pandemic, we cannot let students go hungry. @SecretarySonny must continue to allow flexibility in school meal programs so our children have enough to eat. pic.twitter.com/jmzuRYuruh
Once again Trump is using the military as props in his political schemes. He has said those who serve are “suckers” and now he wants to use them as pawns in his shell game. This should be a VOLUNTARY program, not MANDATORY. federalnewsnetwork.com/pay/2020/09/mi…
It’s totally unacceptable that the OCC wants to write a new rule that would allow predatory payday lenders to charge outrageous interest rates to already vulnerable consumers during the pandemic. Acting Comptroller Brooks must immediately withdraw this proposed rule. twitter.com/vtg2/status/13…
We now know Trump knew this virus would be deadly but downplayed the risks, resulting in more deaths and economic harm. Now, McConnell refuses to provide meaningful relief and is penalizing schools for taking safety measures and giving millionaires tax breaks for private schools. pic.twitter.com/boVk6BhraJ
His emphatic denials only show he knows these revelations will hurt him. Who would tolerate as Commander in Chief someone who calls those who died in service to our country “suckers” and “losers”? theatlantic.com/politics/archi…
Trump has now stated multiple times that, if reelected, he will “terminate” the payroll tax that funds Social Security. Seniors, people with disabilities, and every American should know how devastating this policy could be. So we've asked the experts:

Anyone who thinks the Green New Deal is too “radical” should pay attention to the devastating wildfires on the West Coast, which are directly linked to inaction on climate change. This isn’t about politics—we must act now to save lives and our planet.

First, Trump installs his political crony as Postmaster General to aid in his voter suppression scheme. Now we find out the Chairman of the USPS Board of Governors is also a director of McConnell’s super PAC? Enough, both must resign immediately!

This is a painful and devastating loss for our country. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an American hero, pioneer, and an inspiration to all. Our nation is so much better because of her courage and tireless fight for equality. Rest In Peace, RBG.
Today my wife Katherine and I joined thousands to mark the 57th anniversary of the #MarchOnWashington and demand that the Senate pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. We cannot let up until justice is delivered. Onwards! pic.twitter.com/5m8h7vR1tc

We have urged Trump to reinstate the Obama-era ban on drilling off MD’s shore and former Sec. Zinke assured me they likely would. But again, Trump put politics first, protecting the Atlantic coasts of FL, GA, and SC only. We will prevail in the end.

The EPA has failed to use its authority to ensure that all parties to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement meet their pollution reduction obligations so I applaud the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Maryland Watermen’s Association, and state partners for taking legal action. twitter.com/chesapeakebay/…
This high-level cover-up of Russia’s efforts to throw the election to Donald Trump is a gross dereliction of Sec. Wolf’s sworn duty to protect America from all enemies, foreign and domestic. If true, he should resign. washingtonpost.com/national-secur…
As Election Day draws near, Marylanders should have all the information they need on the process for casting their ballot. As it stands, those who want to vote-by-mail in this election must return their application by October 20th.

Cpl. Waverly Woodson showed heroic courage and, even after being badly wounded, saved dozens of lives on D-Day—but he never received the Medal of Honor because of the color of his skin. We're working with his widow, Joann Woodson, to right this wrong. apnews.com/c8f0d04fff3b49…
The Trump Administration needs to stop treating our troops and federal workers like political pawns and get serious about real economic relief. Americans can see through Trump’s fake payroll scheme.
washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020…
The rise of unions helped build a large and strong American middle class. But as they have been attacked, wages have flattened and income inequality has soared. We must revive and strengthen collective bargaining—and enact bold changes to build a more just, inclusive economy.
I stand in solidarity with the Capital Gazette staff, who are rallying today for workers and journalists. Now, more than ever, we must fight for a free press and for local news sources that inform us about what’s happening in our communities. patch.com/maryland/annap…

When the U.S. joined the Paris Climate Accord four years ago, we were leading the world. Trump made a total U-turn, but people are demanding bold action. We need the Green New Deal and a price on carbon. Good for jobs, wages, clean air, and life on Earth!
Despite statements by Maryland State officials that the backlog in the unemployment system has been cleared, we continue to hear from many Marylanders who haven’t received their benefits in 4+ months. We’re asking the state to immediately fix this problem. baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs…
In a rush to cut costs, @DeptofDefense is jeopardizing access to care for active-duty families and retirees. We're hearing from Maryland families who are concerned about these changes, especially during a pandemic. The Administration owes us answers. baltimoresun.com/maryland/anne-…
