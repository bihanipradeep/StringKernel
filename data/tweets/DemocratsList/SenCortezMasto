The Senate MUST act in a bipartisan way to pass relief legislation that supports families and provides necessary resources to key industries so that they can recover from this pandemic and people can get safely back to work.  cortezmasto.senate.gov/news/press-rel‚Ä¶

There's nothing in the bill that would give additional food assistance for struggling families. And there's no greatly-needed aid to the industries that are the backbone of Nevada‚Äôs economy‚Äîour gaming, hospitality & tourism sectors.

This bill does not address the crisis at hand.
