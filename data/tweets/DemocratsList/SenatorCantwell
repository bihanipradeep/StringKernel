The #GreatAmericanOutdoorsAct is a victory for the vast majority of Americans who do not support this administration‚Äôs efforts to try and dig, drill, or log seemingly every last acre of our public lands. (3/4) pic.twitter.com/wigQjU7OhN

I urged @CommerceGov & @USCensusBureau to honor the previously announced #2020Census completion date of October 31 rather than ending field data collection by September 30. The federal government must ensure a fair & accurate count for Indian Country & all Native populations. pic.twitter.com/k5XOzlkgdM
#PurpleHeartDay is a time to honor the valiant efforts of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen who have sacrificed so much to protect our country. We must be vigilant in ensuring that every one of our veterans gets the care they deserve from a grateful nation. pic.twitter.com/60EWl1hzfF
The role of @USPS in delivering medications to Americans has only grown during the COVID crisis. But Postmaster General DeJoy‚Äôs changes to #USPS have resulted in life-threatening delays of critical medications to Americans who receive their medication through the mail. #SaveUSPS
On this day in 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. shared his dream with the world. We must honor his legacy by working together to build the nation he envisioned and continue the march for equality every day. #MarchOnWashington pic.twitter.com/HLXscncr85
I‚Äôm concerned by reports that @USPS Postmaster DeJoy is implementing policy changes that will increase the cost for timely delivery of election mail. I urged Postmaster DeJoy not take any action that makes it harder & more expensive for Americans to #VoteByMail. #DontMessWithUSPS
Temperature checks provide important data for workers & the traveling public. The legislation I introduced requires @TSA to use temperature screening technology to better protect passenger & worker health, and build public trust in the aviation system.

Free and fair elections are the hallmark of democracy. We must focus on making it easier to vote, not harder - especially during a pandemic.
We know the value of the outdoors in our hearts & souls. Now more than ever, we need to promote access to our public lands. The #GreatAmericanOutdoorsAct is so important for the next generation.

He was a gentle giant with a kind smile who knew how to listen to everyone. When he spoke, a whole lot of wisdom always came out. My heart goes out to his family and friends. He will be greatly missed. (2/2)
I look forward to continuing to work with the House and our Senate colleagues of both parties to achieve the highest safety standards for aviation. (2/2)
Justice Ginsburg was a giant‚Äîour longest-serving female Supreme Court Justice. She will be remembered as a fierce warrior against gender discrimination. Every woman who has ever had to advocate for the law owes her a great debt of gratitude. (1/4)
Black women face a persistent pay gap. Our working families must have equal pay now‚Äîit‚Äôs time for the Senate to end pay discrimination by passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct. #BlackWomensEqualPay
It is outrageous the President wants to deny funding to the U.S. Post Office to stop voting by mail and the Post Master General is taking steps to slow down the mail. twitter.com/nytimes/status‚Ä¶
My thoughts, prayers, and sympathies are with his family and many friends. (2/2)
We need to end systemic racism. Right now, we need to pass the¬†#JusticeinPolicing Act which¬†is sitting in the Senate. The Senate should return to DC and pass it. (2/2)
I‚Äôm very proud to represent a state with a long tradition of women activists and leaders & to carry that tradition forward. This anniversary is a great moment to celebrate the suffragettes, but there is still so much more work to do. #WomensEqualityDay
In Washington we are at over 600,000 acres burned, with 300,000 of those acres burning in just one day. We have to do more to reduce wildfire risk and we need to be aggressive about getting more resources for fighting fires during this record fire season & beyond. #WAWildfire twitter.com/ForestServiceN‚Ä¶
Today‚Äôs report released by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee underscores the critical need for stronger certification, transparency, and accountability for both the FAA and Boeing. It‚Äôs imperative for us to restore leadership in aviation safety. (1/2)
Extending support for aviation jobs in the next COVID relief bill is critical. We need people working in aviation, not standing in unemployment lines. Pilots and flight attendants are already on the front lines delivering important air service. We should continue to support them. twitter.com/afa_cwa/status‚Ä¶
We must continue to invest in technologies like drones, weather tracking, and fire shelters to provide our heroic firefighters the tools they need to safeguard Washington families and their cherished communities. (2/2)
My heart goes out to all the people across our state who have been evacuated, lost their homes and businesses, or otherwise been impacted by the recent wildfires. And thank you to everyone on the ground risking their lives battling to contain the fires. (1/2)
Today we stop to appreciate the contributions of American workers & the labor movement that has served as the backbone of our economy & guardian of the American Dream. We must continue to fight for workers & ensure the minimum wage is a living wage. Have a happy & safe #LaborDay!
when they violate the rights of Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, disabled Americans, and others. (2/2)
President Trump is creating a false narrative to try to score political points. Instead, he should be making sure the Attorney General and @TheJusticeDept are upholding civil rights and holding police departments accountable (1/2) twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/st‚Ä¶

This #WomensEqualityDay we honor the women who struggled hard & long to make sure our democracy included our voices. We know that our country is stronger, more successful, and more inclusive when we include women at every table, board room, ballot box, & in every discussion.
Today is the 104th Birthday of the @NatlParkService! Washington state is lucky to have 3 national parks and many other national historic sites, reserves, trails, and urban green spaces. I‚Äôll keep fighting to protect and expand access to our public lands for generations to come. twitter.com/NationalParkFd‚Ä¶
The Senate must pass the #JusticeInPolicing Act to protect Americans‚Äô civil liberties & ensure police are accountable to uphold them. This is a civil rights issue. It‚Äôs about fighting for equal protection under the law.

I am so glad Alaskan and Washington senators agree that protecting salmon habitat is critical. Those who care about the Northwest economy must be diligent about continuing to fight the #PebbleMine.
The Trump administration & the Army Corps of Engineers finally said what scientists, fishermen, sportsmen, Tribal leaders, & restaurateurs have been saying all along‚Äîa mine at #BristolBay would kill too many salmon & is an unacceptable place for mining.

Millions of Washingtonians rely on the @USPS to not only vote, but to receive medication, veterans‚Äô benefits, social security checks, and other essential goods and services ‚Äì especially in the midst of our current health crisis. They deserve answers.‚Äù#SaveThePostOffice
The voices of millions of outraged Americans forced Postmaster General DeJoy to delay further proposed mail service changes. Now the administration must provide a full public overview of how @USPS will ensure timely delivery of mail moving forward. #SaveThePostOffice
