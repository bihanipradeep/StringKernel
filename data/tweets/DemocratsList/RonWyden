Joined @RepBonamici today in Warrenton to talk about the urgent need to #SaveTheUSPS. 1 in 5 Americans get their prescriptions through the mail. Donald Trump’s USPS sabotage will have a catastrophic impact on the health of our people and our democracy. pic.twitter.com/wrzqLmfyrZ
Heard today in Portland from @PPSConnect parents & teachers about the urgent need for the Senate to take up an A, B, Cs package that helps kids during #COVID19 - Aid to K-12 schools, Better Broadband for students & Childcare support for working parents. pic.twitter.com/K0eE4AYPNN
The 1963 #MarchOnWashington was the definitive peaceful protest demanding change in America. Proud to march today in Portland with @pdxnaacp to mark that historic march, Dr. King’s timeless “I Have A Dream” speech & to support #BlackLivesMatter. pic.twitter.com/C6WFqf2X7L
These jarring photos from my staff in Oregon show you just how dire the situation is right now. Our state is being pummeled by life-threatening fires and smoke. Entire communities have lost their homes or are prepared to. Ignoring the climate crisis is threatening lives. pic.twitter.com/Yx3mMk19ya
Good meeting today in Portland with Jeff Anderson of @UFCW & Bob Tackett of @steelworkers. Their @OregonAFLCIO members are #EssentialWorkers on the front line today and every day during #COVID19. These workers deserve our thanks and real Senate action to protect them. pic.twitter.com/DHPv0fC0iZ
.@morethanmySLE and I are sounding the alarm on the Trump administration’s proposal to weaken the Social Security promise for thousands of Americans with disabilities. This latest cruel scheme will jeopardize access to this critical lifeline for thousands of Americans. pic.twitter.com/c6WDdkClig
While Mike Pence spins a fictional tale of Trump's response to COVID-19, he's allowed nursing homes across the nation to run out of PPE during a pandemic that's proven most deadly to older generations. @SenBobCasey and I are sounding the alarm. finance.senate.gov/ranking-member…
This is part of an escalating pattern of law breaking and contempt for democracy as well as a betrayal of the hardworking people trying to keep the country safe from foreign adversaries. And it is yet more proof that DNI Ratcliffe’s partisanship is making America less secure.
Memo to Trump: the protests In Portland have been overwhelmingly peaceful. All you’ve done is inflame the situation here in Portland and nationwide with your reckless rhetoric and your feckless directives.
Here in #RipCity, long-time @trailblazers like Cliff Robinson always hold a special place in our hearts and in the hearts of Blazers fans everywhere. Very sorry to hear today of Cliff’s passing and sending condolences to his family and loved ones.
Russia is once again interfering in our elections to get Donald Trump elected and, rather than defend American democracy, Trump and his partisan intelligence leadership are trying to keep the facts from Congress.
This cannot stand. Congress can issue subpoenas and hold uncooperative officials in contempt. Congress must also ensure that patriotic whistleblowers who come forward with information the administration is trying to hide are protected.
Our country could not have survived the last 6 months without the hard work and dedication of essential workers. May #LaborDay serve as an opportunity to recommit to the fight for fairer wages, better working conditions and better services to help our essential workers.
There’s nothing subtle about how Donald Trump’s cronies are politicizing intelligence and weakening our country. twitter.com/ABC/status/130…
This order is plainly illegal. Portland is not a toy in Trump’s authoritarian playset. twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/st…
I’m leading the fight to get federal assistance to help states as fires rage in the West. I’ll continue pulling out all the stops to ensure our communities have the resources they need to respond to and recover from these devastating fires. wyden.senate.gov/news/press-rel…
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a once-in-a-generation role model and champion of equal rights. This is such an extraordinary loss for our country.
I know there’s a lot going on, but Oregon and much of the Pacific Northwest is currently ablaze. Everyone should be paying attention. Thanks to the climate crisis, this is our new reality. twitter.com/CPitawanichKGW…
Combatting fire danger in the West requires addressing both the climate crisis and forest management challenges with common-sense, science-based solutions. Good forest management policy is good climate policy. bizjournals.com/portland/news/…
For four years, Donald Trump has talked a big game about lowering drug prices. That's a great campaign talking point, but actions speak louder than words. So ask yourself this question: in the last four years, have your drug costs gone down?
Just boarded a flight back home from DC to meet with Oregon state & local officials & community members to get on-the-ground fire updates. Thankful for all the hard work of first responders, firefighters & volunteers working 24-7 to keep us safe from these devastating fires.
This election is unlike any our country has ever seen. If you don't already have one, it's time to make a plan to vote in November. The future of our country depends on it. washingtonpost.com/elections/2020…
While Democrats push for aggressive action against Russian assets interfering in our elections Republicans are parroting them to advance bogus investigations. Senate investigations shouldn't rely on conspiracy theories pushed by shady characters trying to undermine our democracy.
Andrii Derkach has been central in advancing the Russian disinformation that underpins Senate Republicans’ effort to smear Vice President Biden. He is now under U.S. sanctions for his efforts to interfere in the election. twitter.com/kenvogel/statu…
Verma's rampant abuse of nearly $6 million taxpayer dollars dwarfs that of former HHS Secretary Tom Price, who resigned in disgrace for inappropriately spending $340,000 of taxpayer money on private planes.
Medicare and Medicaid chief Seema Verma is the latest Trump official to use taxpayer dollars like a personal piggy bank. @SeemaCMS must pay back taxpayers the $6 million she spent hiring GOP consultants to write speeches, arrange lunches and chauffeur her to meetings. twitter.com/ddiamond/statu…
The fires in Oregon continue to threaten communities all over our state. Stay informed with the most up-to-date information from @OregonOEM and continue to take the advice of your local authorities to keep you and your loved ones safe. twitter.com/OregonOEM/stat…
From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the severity of this crisis. Black Americans are disproportionately paying the price for his incompetence and inaction. I’ve been calling on Trump officials to track and report data on how #COVID19 is impacting Black nursing home residents. twitter.com/washingtonpost…
Oregon’s entire congressional delegation is united in backing the governor’s request for rapid approval of federal disaster relief for our state. Oregonians need support ASAP to respond to these devastating wildfires & to recover after this disaster: wyden.senate.gov/news/press-rel…
The fire situation in Oregon is evolving rapidly. Be sure to follow the recommendations of your local firefighters and law enforcement. Here are critical resources to help you and your loved ones stay safe if you need to evacuate or have already done so: wildfire.oregon.gov

Thanks to everybody putting in long hours around Oregon to protect lives and preserve homes and busineses. My message this morning to all Oregonians is to please follow any evacuation orders from these hardworking firefighters and first responders.
I’m working with my colleagues in the Oregon congressional delegation, the governor & local officials to make sure our state has the short-term resources needed to survive these wildfires & the long-term aid to rebound from this devastation.
These unprecedented wildfires threatening so many Oregon communities on top of the ongoing public health crisis and its economic fallout add up to a heartbreakingly difficult combination of challenges for thousands of our neighbors and loved ones. oregonlive.com/pacific-northw…
Oregonians: help protect yourself and your community by following campfire restrictions and by following the recommendations of your local law enforcement. We’re all in this together.
A giant thank you to all the firefighters and first responders protecting Oregonians from harm amid the wildfires and high winds whipping through communities across our state. Oregon is fortunate to have all of you on the front lines. oregonlive.com/weather/2020/0…
