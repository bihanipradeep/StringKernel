Climate change shouldn’t be a partisan issue. All you have to do is look outside or read the news to see what’s happening in California right now. I'm glad @SenRubio joined me in calling for the specific recommendations in this report and I encourage everyone to read it. pic.twitter.com/Yc4vJeQd58

As the start of fiscal year 2021 approaches, we’re once again calling on the administration to engage in good-faith consultation with us. The United States is a beacon of hope around the world, and we should uphold that role by admitting those most in need to our country. pic.twitter.com/ZbyhvWhvCs
We can’t let this important treaty expire without a successor agreement in place. By extending the current treaty we’ll have more time to negotiate a new one. This isn’t a partisan issue. Read our bipartisan letter to the president here: pic.twitter.com/wdP5DR2Icy
Nearly 15% of California residents have yet to be counted in the #2020Census. In light of challenges created by COVID-19, wildfires and the recent decision to end counting operations a month early, the Census Bureau must detail how it will achieve an accurate count. pic.twitter.com/9saylwk08h
I encourage everyone to maintain coronavirus health protocols over this Labor Day weekend. Our economy and our lives depend on it.

Between wildfires, COVID-19 and the decision to end counting operations a month early, it’s going to be hard to complete an accurate #2020Census. I joined @RepZoeLofgren and @RepJimmyGomez to ask @USCensusBureau how it will uphold its duty to count everyone. pic.twitter.com/967yO1E8Ti
If you’ve already completed the #2020Census, great! There are only 20 days left to tell your friends and family to do the same. Have them go to my2020census.gov to get started. Everyone needs to be counted so California gets the representation and funding it deserves.
Time is running out to complete the #2020Census. The Constitution is clear that everyone, regardless of age, race, ethnicity or citizenship status, must be counted every 10 years as part of the census. Go to my2020census.gov to get started.
There are only 30 days left to be counted in the #2020Census. EVERYONE living in the United States must be counted. Go to my2020census.gov to get started and then tell your friends and family to do the same!
Wildfires have already burned millions of acres in California this year, and we’ve only just entered our traditional fire season. We need help ASAP. @USAirForce and @LockheedMartin need to ensure there are no further delays in the transfer of firefighting aircraft. pic.twitter.com/ineNmqKvll
Stars and Stripes is essential to the military community. Its $15.5 million budget is only a tiny fraction of the entire DOD budget, so there’s no reason to discontinue its funding.

As evacuation orders from wildfires are lifted across California, it’s important to remain vigilant when returning to your home. Be sure to follow this checklist and make sure there are no lingering embers that could spark a fire. pic.twitter.com/GsSeSyM3nL
Massive wildfires driven by climate change are devastating the Western United States. I’m glad our bipartisan bill will receive a hearing next week and hope it will quickly move through the Senate. We can’t afford to do nothing while these wildfires get worse every year. pic.twitter.com/E141vPH9Lt
The November election is just two months away. If you’re not registered to vote, now is the time to do so! Visit sos.ca.gov/elections/elec… for more information.
Judiciary Committee Democrats to Chairman Graham: “There cannot be one set of rules for a Republican President and one set for a Democratic President, and considering a nominee before the next inauguration would be wholly inappropriate.” Full letter here: feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.c…
The FCC needs to expand internet access for students across the country. The coronavirus pandemic has forced millions to switch to online learning, but reports indicate that as many as 16 million students are without reliable access to the internet. That’s unacceptable. pic.twitter.com/ZCEUyUfjlh
If you haven’t yet completed the census, go to my2020census.gov to get started. It only takes a few minutes and all responses are secure and confidential. Everyone living in California, regardless of age, race, ethnicity or citizenship status, must be counted.
The intelligence community has confirmed that Russia, among other foreign adversaries, is again working to influence this November’s election. The Treasury Department must immediately impose sanctions on those working to undermine our democracy. pic.twitter.com/nBtGy37NN0

We asked @CFTC for recommendations on how to manage climate risk, because it’s clear that climate change poses serious threats to the financial system, much as it does to so many aspects of our lives. We must act now. twitter.com/NYTNational/st…

The administration has violated the law for the last three years by not consulting Congress on the number of refugees that will be admitted into the country. The law is clear that an administration must consult with Congress before the start of each fiscal year.
Yesterday, President Trump blocked drilling off the coasts of Florida, Georgia & South Carolina, but not the West Coast. The Senate needs to join the House and pass the West Coast Protection Act to extend drilling bans off the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington, ASAP. twitter.com/McClatchyDC/st…
I’d like to thank @RiteAid for making these stamps available at all their locations in the United States. This is a great opportunity to support both the Postal Service and breast cancer research.

Happy 170th birthday to California! On this day in 1850, California was admitted to the Union as the 31st state. I’m proud of how far our state has come, growing to become the fifth largest economy in the world and a beacon of progress for our country.

California is no stranger to wildfires, but this year is particularly bad. Our bill would increase the use of tools like prescribed burns, promote removal of dead and dying trees and help communities and businesses prepare. Read my op-ed:

#NationalPreparednessMonth is a good time to develop a response plan in case of a natural disaster. Not only is California susceptible to wildfires, but as we saw in Ridgecrest last year, we’re also prone to large earthquakes.

Wildfires are burning across California and evacuation orders are in effect for many parts of the state. Please continue to adhere to all instructions from local authorities. For the latest statewide information, go to fire.ca.gov/incidents.
There are only three weeks left to complete the #2020Census and help ensure California receives the funding and representation we deserve. Go to my2020census.gov to get started, then encourage your friends and family to do the same. Everyone MUST be counted!
President Trump needs to immediately extend New START, our last remaining bilateral nuclear arms control agreement with Russia. The treaty will expire in February if President Trump doesn’t trigger a five-year extension.

After Memorial Day and the Fourth of July we saw large surges in coronavirus cases. We can’t see a repeat of that this holiday weekend. Please be smart, avoid large gatherings, wear a mask and adhere to physical distancing guidelines. Our economy and lives depend on it.
Please continue following all public health guidance this weekend. We’ve made progress in getting this virus under control and we can’t let up now. We must not repeat the mistakes we made over Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.
