A brave whistleblower has come forward with this deeply disturbing, heartbreaking report. We need immediate answers, because forced sterilizations are completely inhumane and appalling. This has no place in any society—let alone our own. msnbc.com/all-in/watch/i…
We need to do more to protect nature. This is alarming— especially in light of @Interior’s abandonment of enforcement tools that protect these animals.

Mistreating our environment spirals into the loss of important species, and that’s bad for humanity. nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/…
This Constitution Day, we must confront our broken electoral politics with a plan to ensure our government truly works #ForThePeople. It’s time to pass our #DemocracyForAll amendment to overturn Citizens United. My Op-Ed in @santafereporter: sfreporter.com/columns/oped/2…
September is National Recovery Month. Making sure our loved ones can get the help and services they need is essential. I’m committed to making sure all families in NM and across the nation looking for support can get the help they need without stigma.
Over the course of William Perry Pendley’s 40 yr career, he’s been one of the premier anti-public lands crusaders in the nation. He has made well-documented racist statements. And he’s hostile to real science. He has no place leading @BLMNational. thehill.com/policy/energy-…
In the middle of a global pandemic, Donald Trump is STILL trying to gut Americans' health care coverage when they need it most and eliminate critical protections for preexisting conditions—with absolutely no backup plan. Utterly cruel. cnn.com/2020/09/16/pol…
I am standing firm with @senatedems to restore unemployment assistance at $600 dollars per week as Republicans refuse to fully fund this financial lifeline. We must do more to help the American people through #COVID19. It's past time for action.

The president is a climate change denier. He doesn’t understand the science and puts our country in danger daily with his outright refusal to #ActOnClimate.

19 years ago today the 2001 AUMF was signed into law. Over time, it has been stretched beyond recognition and should not still be used to permit wars unauthorized by Congress nearly two decades later. We must to pass the AFGHAN Service Act to end the endless wars.
Big corporations actively obstruct action on climate change through trade associations that lobby Congress. It’s time to put some public pressure on these companies to demand that we #ActOnClimate. #TradeUp
