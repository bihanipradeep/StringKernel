200,000 Americans are now dead because we have an incompetent chief executive who cares about no one except himself. 

Yes, this election just got more complicated, but this isn't complicated - 

if Trump wins, another 200,000 die.
If Republicans push through a Supreme Court nominee, within weeks the Affordable Care Act will be gone (a case is pending).

20 million Americans will lose their health insurance and rates will skyrocket for anyone with a preexisting condition.

In the middle of a pandemic.
If Republicans go forward and reverse the precedent they set in 2016, the Senate will never, ever be the same. It will be changed forever.

I pray tonight that at least a few of my Republican colleagues understand this.
Hey @brianschatz here’s my big idea.

Can we raise $100K (yes $100K) for Steve Bullock?

I checked - the last poll has the Montana Senate race TIED. And it’s the tipping point race. We win, McConnell’s out of a job.

Here’s the link. I think we can do it.

This is nuclear grade incompetence.

First they said asymptomatic people who get exposed should be tested.

Then they reversed the guidance after pressure from the White House.

Today they reversed the guidance again. 3 different rules in 30 days. thedailybeast.com/centers-for-di…
The top issue for voters in 2018 was health care. The ACA repeal effort cost Republicans millions of votes. 

With a case to repeal the ACA (and replace it with nothing) currently on the Supreme Court docket, ACA repeal just became - once again - a defining issue of the election.
He’s deliberately killing people. He is. Why don’t we just say this out loud?

He’s not just intentionally violating state mandates designed to save lives; he’s reveling in it. 

It’s sadistic. twitter.com/anniekarni/sta…
Tradition will not matter when the controlling faction is Alito-Thomas-Gorsuch-Kavanaugh-Coney Barrett.

.@brianschatz - final total for Steve Bullock last night:

$118,249 from 3,173 donors. Just bananas. Thanks to everyone who pitched in to help flip the Senate.

Bullock is a leader on finding common ground on climate, fighting dark money, Medicaid expansion. And a great guy too.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg changed her nation for the better. Fairness and justice, especially for those with the least access to power, were her north stars. She was a pioneer for women in the law, and a cultural icon on top of it all. May she rest in peace.
I can’t imagine a better investment. If Warnock wins in Georgia (and the race is close!) then Democrats control the Senate. AND we get a civil rights leader (the pastor of MLK’s church) in Congress. Give what you can today.

Challenge accepted, Schatz. 

Let’s raise some money for great Senate candidates who are going to help us get to 51 and end Mitch McConell’s destructive reign as Majority Leader. 

Like today. Where do we start? twitter.com/brianschatz/st…

Wow. In 6 hours, we raised $100,000 to flip the Montana Senate seat. That’s a BIG DEAL. 

Thank you to everybody who made this amazing thing happen. 

But it’s only 10pm (4pm Schatz time) and football is still on. You’re still awake and we can push this to $120,00 by midnight. twitter.com/brianschatz/st…

A huge story from the ⁦@hartfordcourant⁩. There isn’t a more respected prosecutor in CT than Nora Dannehy. 

Looks like the fix is in, unsurprisingly. Trump is turning Durham’s report into a campaign pamphlet.  courant.com/news/connectic…
Bri, my staffer just texted me - Pence is going to Montana tomorrow to campaign against Bullock. Tomorrow!

Wouldn’t it be awesome if by the time Pence landed, Bullock’s campaign had $100,000 in new money in the bank??

I was so thrown by this exchange w Redfield yesterday, where he basically tells me not to believe my lying eyes. Claims the new rules that clearly dramatically roll back testing actually don’t. 

Now I get it. NYT reports tonight the rules were forced on CDC by the White House. twitter.com/dncwarroom/sta…
Of course this recommendation didn’t come from doctors at the CDC. 

No doctor in their right mind would tell someone who had been in close contact with someone w COVID to NOT get tested.

The CDC is becoming an arm of the President’s re-election campaign. nytimes.com/2020/09/17/hea…
860,000 Americans filed for unemployment last week. 1200 people died of COVID yesterday.
