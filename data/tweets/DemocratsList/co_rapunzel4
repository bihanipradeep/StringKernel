Me too!
I had such a desire to slap the TV.
WHOA.
What a sweetheart.😻
Succinct. 😂
Thankfully, I missed those.
Bravo, Ed!💙
No, your tweet is ludicrous.
I blocked that account. I found it rather fishy.
Describes him well.
OMG. I don't know the answer to that. What did you say?
That could be their campaign slogan.
That’s my thought, too. All day long. 😞
So sorry to hear that. I couldn't cope with that. 🤪
He's a thread invader hoping for some attention.
Thank you. Certainly. Nice to meet you.💙
I blocked that guy, too.
Like attracts like.
I hope we have one open up by us.
He doesn’t read, remember?
Do they kill a new ferret every day to do Trump's hair?

Many Americans are asking.
People used to vote for Republicans because they were supposedly the party of values. Now they vote for Republicans because they have no values— just racism, bigotry, misogyny, xenophobia, and just plain nastiness.

Isn’t it interesting how Republicans don’t seem to care that we have lost 200,000 Americans to the coronavirus. Their leader’s incompetence has brought us to this point. They continue to flout masking. Yet they claim to care so deeply about embryos.

So am I.
What a horrible, disrespectful, juvenile tweet. Guess it shows the nonexistent cut of your jib, Doug Collins. You're not pro-life, you're pro-greed. You and your party are bereft of humanity. You don't represent us--you're the lunatic fringe. twitter.com/CollinsforGA/s…
Brava, Yvonne! I so agree!💙👊🏼
#GaetzWontDebate
Matt Gaetz isn't qualified to debate anything other than which beer he'll be guzzling tonight.
Vote for @JoeBiden —he will listen to the scientists, not the my pillow guy.
Sorry, @BluePirate_ , forgot to reply to you. Duh.🤪 twitter.com/co_rapunzel4/s…
And they are definitely not voting for Donald Trump!
I don't know about you, but I simply cannot wait to see Susan Collins lose.

And she is losing. 😉
This is how we do it! twitter.com/raolivieri/sta…
Doing the same. Dropping it off at the Fairfax Co. Government Center.
Hey, neighbor! I'm proud of my county.💙
The lines to vote here in Fairfax County are off the charts! 

This is the biggest early voting crowd EVER here. And Fairfax is SOLIDLY blue. 💙🌊🇺🇸

Great news for #JoeBiden, very bad news for #TrumptheTraitor !!
Polls are open for early voting in Virginia today. The turnout is great in Alexandria. Proud of my fellow Alexandrians! I'll be dropping my ballot off in the official drop box. 

Say goodbye, Trump! It's going to be an avalanche for Biden/Harris!🇺🇸💙

#JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020
Brilliant, Ms. O'Connell! Wish I could still say the same about Van Morrison.
When people said Trump would kill us all, it wasn’t hyperbole. He’s already killed 200,000 Americans with his negligence & depraved indifference.  

If he gets another four years to squat in the White House, rest assured he’ll kill hundreds of thousands more.
