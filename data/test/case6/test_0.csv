Enter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners.FLAVIUS. Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.Is this a holiday? What, know you not,Being mechanical, you ought not walkUpon a laboring day without the sign
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?FIRST COMMONER. Why, sir, a carpenter.MARULLUS. Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
You, sir, what trade are you?SECOND COMMONER. Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I ambut, as you would say, a cobbler.MARULLUS. But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
SECOND COMMONER. A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safeconscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.MARULLUS. What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?SECOND COMMONER. Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet,
if you be out, sir, I can mend you.MARULLUS. What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!SECOND COMMONER. Why, sir, cobble you.FLAVIUS. Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
SECOND COMMONER. Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; Imeddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with awl.I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are ingreat danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.FLAVIUS. But wherefore art not in thy shop today?Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?SECOND COMMONER. Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself
into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesarand to rejoice in his triumph.MARULLUS. Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?What tributaries follow him to Rome
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,Your infants in your arms, and there have satThe livelong day with patient expectation
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.And when you saw his chariot but appear,Have you not made an universal shoutThat Tiber trembled underneath her banks
To hear the replication of your soundsMade in her concave shores?And do you now put on your best attire?And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his wayThat comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?Be gone!Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plagueThat needs must light on this ingratitude.FLAVIUS. Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,Assemble all the poor men of your sort,
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tearsInto the channel, till the lowest streamDo kiss the most exalted shores of all.Exeunt all Commoners.
See whether their basest metal be not moved;They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.Go you down that way towards the Capitol;This way will I. Disrobe the images
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.MARULLUS. May we do so?You know it is the feast of Lupercal.FLAVIUS. It is no matter; let no images
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll aboutAnd drive away the vulgar from the streets;So do you too, where you perceive them thick.These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,Who else would soar above the view of menAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness.              Exeunt.Flourish. Enter Caesar; Antony, for the course; Calpurnia, Portia,
Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and Casca; a great crowd follows,among them a Soothsayer.CAESAR. Calpurnia!CASCA. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
Music ceases.CAESAR. Calpurnia!CALPURNIA. Here, my lord.CAESAR. Stand you directly in Antonio's way,
When he doth run his course. Antonio!ANTONY. Caesar, my lord?CAESAR. Forget not in your speed, Antonio,To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say
The barren, touched in this holy chase,Shake off their sterile curse.ANTONY. I shall remember.When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform'd.
CAESAR. Set on, and leave no ceremony out Flourish.SOOTHSAYER. Caesar!CAESAR. Ha! Who calls?CASCA. Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!
CAESAR. Who is it in the press that calls on me?I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,Cry "Caesar." Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR. What man is that?BRUTUS. A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.CAESAR. Set him before me let me see his face.CASSIUS. Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
CAESAR. What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.CAESAR. He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.Sennet. Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius.
CASSIUS. Will you go see the order of the course?BRUTUS. Not I.CASSIUS. I pray you, do.BRUTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;I'll leave you.CASSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
I have not from your eyes that gentlenessAnd show of love as I was wont to have;You bear too stubborn and too strange a handOver your friend that loves you.
BRUTUS. Cassius,Be not deceived; if I have veil'd my look,I turn the trouble of my countenanceMerely upon myself. Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference,Conceptions only proper to myself,Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-
Among which number, Cassius, be you one-Nor construe any further my neglectThan that poor Brutus with himself at warForgets the shows of love to other men.
CASSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,By means whereof this breast of mine hath buriedThoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
BRUTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itselfBut by reflection, by some other things.CASSIUS. 'Tis just,And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turnYour hidden worthiness into your eyeThat you might see your shadow. I have heardWhere many of the best respect in Rome,
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of BrutusAnd groaning underneath this age's yoke,Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.BRUTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myselfFor that which is not in me?CASSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I your glassWill modestly discover to yourselfThat of yourself which you yet know not of.And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;
Were I a common laugher, or did useTo stale with ordinary oaths my loveTo every new protester, if you knowThat I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them, or if you knowThat I profess myself in banquetingTo all the rout, then hold me dangerous.Flourish and shout.
BRUTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the peopleChoose Caesar for their king.CASSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?Then must I think you would not have it so.
BRUTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.But wherefore do you hold me here so long?What is it that you would impart to me?If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honor in one eye and death i' the otherAnd I will look on both indifferently.For let the gods so speed me as I loveThe name of honor more than I fear death.
CASSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,As well as I do know your outward favor.Well, honor is the subject of my story.I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life, but, for my single self,I had as lief not be as live to beIn awe of such a thing as I myself.I was born free as Caesar, so were you;
We both have fed as well, and we can bothEndure the winter's cold as well as he.For once, upon a raw and gusty day,The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius, nowLeap in with me into this angry floodAnd swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,Enter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners.FLAVIUS. Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.
Is this a holiday? What, know you not,Being mechanical, you ought not walkUpon a laboring day without the signOf your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
FIRST COMMONER. Why, sir, a carpenter.MARULLUS. Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?What dost thou with thy best apparel on?You, sir, what trade are you?
Alarum within. Enter King, Malcome, Donalbaine, Lenox, withattendants, meeting a bleeding Captaine.King. What bloody man is that? he can report,As seemeth by his plight, of the ReuoltThe newest state

And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,Shew'd like a Rebells Whore: but all's too weake:For braue Macbeth (well hee deserues that Name)Disdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,
Which smoak'd with bloody execution(Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,Till hee fac'd the Slaue:Which neu'r shooke hands, nor bad farwell to him,
Till he vnseam'd him from the Naue toth' Chops,And fix'd his Head vpon our BattlementsKing. O valiant Cousin, worthy GentlemanCap. As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection,
Shipwracking Stormes, and direfull Thunders:So from that Spring, whence comfort seem'd to come,Discomfort swells: Marke King of Scotland, marke,No sooner Iustice had, with Valour arm'd,

King. Dismay'd not this our Captaines, Macbeth andBanquoh?Cap. Yes, as Sparrowes, Eagles;Or the Hare, the Lyon:
If I say sooth, I must report they wereAs Cannons ouer-charg'd with double Cracks,So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe:Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,
Or memorize another Golgotha,I cannot tell: but I am faint,My Gashes cry for helpeKing. So well thy words become thee, as thy wounds,
They smack of Honor both: Goe get him Surgeons.Enter Rosse and Angus.Who comes here?Mal. The worthy Thane of Rosse
Lenox. What a haste lookes through his eyes?So should he looke, that seemes to speake things strangeRosse. God saue the KingKing. Whence cam'st thou, worthy Thane?

Who is sweet Fortunes Minion, and her Pride:Whil'st I by looking on the praise of him,See Ryot and Dishonor staine the browOf my yong Harry. O that it could be prou'd,

Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well;We leave you now with better company.SALERIO. I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,If worthier friends had not prevented me.
ANTONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard.I take it your own business calls on you,And you embrace th' occasion to depart.SALERIO. Good morrow, my good lords.
BASSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.You grow exceeding strange; must it be so?SALERIO. We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO
LORENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,We two will leave you; but at dinner-time,I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.BASSANIO. I will not fail you.
GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio;You have too much respect upon the world;They lose it that do buy it with much care.Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd.
ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-A stage, where every man must play a part,And mine a sad one.GRATIANO. Let me play the fool.
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;And let my liver rather heat with wineThan my heart cool with mortifying groans.Why should a man whose blood is warm within
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster,Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundiceBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio-I love thee, and 'tis my love that speaks-
There are a sort of men whose visagesDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,And do a wilful stillness entertain,With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.'O my Antonio, I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wiseFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,If they should speak, would almost damn those earsWhich, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
I'll tell thee more of this another time.But fish not with this melancholy baitFor this fool gudgeon, this opinion.Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile;
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.LORENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.I must be one of these same dumb wise men,For Gratiano never lets me speak.
GRATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe,Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.ANTONIO. Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.GRATIANO. Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
In a neat's tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZOANTONIO. Is that anything now?BASSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
thanany man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheathidin, two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find
them, and when you have them they are not worth the search.ANTONIO. Well; tell me now what lady is the sameTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,That you to-day promis'd to tell me of?
BASSANIO. 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,How much I have disabled mine estateBy something showing a more swelling portThan my faint means would grant continuance;
Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'dFrom such a noble rate; but my chief careIs to come fairly off from the great debtsWherein my time, something too prodigal,
Hath left me gag'd. To you, Antonio,I owe the most, in money and in love;And from your love I have a warrantyTo unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.ANTONIO. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;And if it stand, as you yourself still do,Within the eye of honour, be assur'd
My purse, my person, my extremest means,Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.BASSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The self-same way, with more advised watch,To find the other forth; and by adventuring bothI oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth,That which I owe is lost; but if you pleaseTo shoot another arrow that self wayWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both,Or bring your latter hazard back againAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;And out of doubt you do me now more wrongIn making question of my uttermostThan if you had made waste of all I have.
Then do but say to me what I should doThat in your knowledge may by me be done,And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak.BASSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left,
And she is fair and, fairer than that word,Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyesI did receive fair speechless messages.Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu'd
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth;For the four winds blow in from every coastRenowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strond,And many Jasons come in quest of her.O my Antonio, had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,I have a mind presages me such thriftThat I should questionless be fortunate.ANTONIO. Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodityTo raise a present sum; therefore go forth,Try what my credit can in Venice do;That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.Go presently inquire, and so will I,Where money is; and I no question makeTo have it of my trust or for my sake
Enter PORTIA with her waiting-woman, NERISSAPORTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of thisgreat world.NERISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
thesame abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aughtIsee, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that
starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, tobeseated in the mean: superfluity come sooner by white hairs,but
competency lives longer.PORTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.NERISSA. They would be better, if well followed.PORTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,
chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes'palaces. It is a good divine that follows his owninstructions; Ican easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be
oneof the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain maydeviselaws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold
decree;such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o'er the meshes ofgoodcounsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion
tochoose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose'! I may neitherchoose who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the willof a
living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father. Is itnothard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their
deathhave good inspirations; therefore the lott'ry that he hathdevised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead-whereof
who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never bechosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. Butwhat warmth is there in your affection towards any of theseprincely suitors that are already come?
PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, Iwilldescribe them; and according to my description, level at myaffection.
NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.PORTIA. Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talkofhis horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own
goodparts that he can shoe him himself; I am much afear'd my ladyhismother play'd false with a smith.
NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine.PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An youwillnot have me, choose.' He hears merry tales and smiles not. I
fearhe will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old,being sofull of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
marriedto a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either ofthese. God defend me from these two!NERISSA. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
Either to die the death, or to abjureFor ever the society of men.Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,Know of your youth, examine well your blood,Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,To live a barren sister all your life,Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessèd they that master so their bloodTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage,But earthlier happy is the rose distill’dThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,
Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.HERMIA.So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwishèd yokeMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.THESEUS.Take time to pause; and by the next new moon
The sealing-day betwixt my love and meFor everlasting bond of fellowship,Upon that day either prepare to dieFor disobedience to your father’s will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,Or on Diana’s altar to protestFor aye austerity and single life.DEMETRIUS.
Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yieldThy crazèd title to my certain right.LYSANDER.You have her father’s love, Demetrius.
Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.EGEUS.Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;And what is mine my love shall render him;
And she is mine, and all my right of herI do estate unto Demetrius.LYSANDER.I am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,
As well possess’d; my love is more than his;My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,If not with vantage, as Demetrius’;And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.Why should not I then prosecute my right?Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,Upon this spotted and inconstant man.THESEUS.
I must confess that I have heard so much,And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;But, being over-full of self-affairs,My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.I have some private schooling for you both.—For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourselfTo fit your fancies to your father’s will,
Or else the law of Athens yields you up(Which by no means we may extenuate)To death, or to a vow of single life.Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go along;I must employ you in some businessAgainst our nuptial, and confer with youOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.
EGEUS.With duty and desire we follow you.[Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia.]LYSANDER.
How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?How chance the roses there do fade so fast?HERMIA.Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.LYSANDER.Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth.But either it was different in blood—HERMIA.O cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.
LYSANDER.Or else misgraffèd in respect of years—HERMIA.O spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.
LYSANDER.Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—HERMIA.O hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!
LYSANDER.Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,Making it momentany as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,Brief as the lightning in the collied nightThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,And, ere a man hath power to say, ‘Behold!’
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:So quick bright things come to confusion.HERMIA.If then true lovers have ever cross’d,
It stands as an edict in destiny.Then let us teach our trial patience,Because it is a customary cross,As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.LYSANDER.A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Of great revenue, and she hath no child.From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,And she respects me as her only son.There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,
And to that place the sharp Athenian lawCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;And in the wood, a league without the town
(Where I did meet thee once with HelenaTo do observance to a morn of May),There will I stay for thee.HERMIA.
My good Lysander!I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,By his best arrow with the golden head,By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,And by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queenWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,By all the vows that ever men have broke
(In number more than ever women spoke),In that same place thou hast appointed me,Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.LYSANDER.
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.Enter Helena.HERMIA.God speed fair Helena! Whither away?
HELENA.Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.Sickness is catching. O were favour so,Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,The rest I’d give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look, and with what artYou sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!HERMIA.I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
HELENA.O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!HERMIA.I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
HELENA.O that my prayers could such affection move!HERMIA.The more I hate, the more he follows me.
HELENA.The more I love, the more he hateth me.HERMIA.His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
HELENA.None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!HERMIA.Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
Lysander and myself will fly this place.Before the time I did Lysander see,Seem’d Athens as a paradise to me.O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn’d a heaven into hell!LYSANDER.Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass,Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),Through Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.
HERMIA.And in the wood where often you and IUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
There my Lysander and myself shall meet,And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,To seek new friends and stranger companies.Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sightFrom lovers’ food, till morrow deep midnight.LYSANDER.
I will, my Hermia.[Exit Hermia.]Helena, adieu.As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
