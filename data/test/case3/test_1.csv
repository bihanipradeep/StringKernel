We're in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are, what we stand for, and who we want to be — it's all at stake. We've got to beat Donald Trump. Register to vote today to help us do it: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
Be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Wear a mask.
Our nation was founded on a simple idea: All men—and women—are created equal. We’ve never fully lived up to it, but we won’t stop trying. As we mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, let’s make sure we don’t wait another 100 years to fulfill that founding promise.
Donald Trump still doesn’t have a plan to get this virus under control. His failure to lead is costing American lives. Here’s what I’ll do as president: https://t.co/etpUGBkONZ https://t.co/aK3GjwG4vw
A good step forward. Yet President Trump continues to do everything he can to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. I will defend the rights of all Americans to have access to quality, affordable health care, free from discrimination. https://t.co/zOR0dXH1rt
Tonight we saw that Americans are ready to come together, and that we the people can overcome these crises and emerge stronger than ever. Chip in to help us beat Donald Trump and set our nation on a new path. #DemConvention https://t.co/mSBDdj70eu "If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it. " #DemConvention https://t.co/TDonFz6iHx "Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head...it is what it is. " #DemConvention https://t.co/OArXv15lVV "A president's words have the power to move markets. They can start wars or broker peace. They can summon our better angels or awaken our worst instincts. You simply cannot fake your way through this job. " #DemConvention https://t.co/ZH1EDg28Al
The leaders who ran in the 2020 primary with me represent the best of America. They made me a better candidate, and they make us a better nation. I am proud to have their support. Together, we will defeat Donald Trump. #DemConvention https://t.co/BOztd8iR0b
“Out of many, Americans are one.” — @AmyKlobuchar #DemConvention https://t.co/88d1V3kPmk
Governor @GretchenWhitmer — thank you for your support and for meeting the COVID-19 crisis with the urgency it demands. The people of Michigan are lucky to have you leading the way. #DemConvention https://t.co/ef2d4DldRV "I believe that Americans have more in common than what divides us. " I couldn't agree more. What we need to do in both Alabama and Washington is to bring folks together. @DougJones knows that in his core. #DemConvention https://t.co/EIoZDW8ucw
If we want to build back better and deliver real change for the American people, then we've got to flip the U.S. Senate. And the path to doing so runs right through Maine. Thank you, @SaraGideon for being with us tonight. #DemConvention https://t.co/1eyIpC81vC
No family should go through the pain that Kristin and her family have gone through. #DemConvention https://t.co/LgyabNxxFy
.@AndrewCuomo, thank you for your leadership and the example you’ve set for all Americans during this pandemic. #DemConvention https://t.co/Ir11a1vJQs
George Floyd had a giving spirit. I see that in his family, I see that in his daughter. George Floyd should be alive today. #DemConvention https://t.co/hGqZysA5Ng
Thank you, Congressman Clyburn. https://t.co/8E3h8sjabu
These last few months have been a wake-up call for our nation. It's up to all of us to do the work to create that more perfect union we've always strived to be. I'm proud of @DemConvention for tonight's powerful conversation on racial justice. #DemConvention https://t.co/Iij5J752xB

Thank you @Gwen4Congress and the people of Milwaukee for hosting this year's Democratic National Convention. I wish we could be there to celebrate in person, but I look forward to virtually coming together with folks across the country to make history. #DemConvention

We’re just over an hour away from night one of the @DemConvention. I hope you’ll join me and Democrats across the country as we unite around our vision for a better America. Tune in at 9 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/Gh4ZGgPWXH
Just imagine where we would be right now if we had a president who listened to the scientists.
Secretary Esper and President Trump, it's a president's job to protect the health and safety of our troops and their families. Gutting the military health care system — no less during a global pandemic — is unacceptable. https://t.co/lXpcSdm8au
There are only 78 days until Election Day — and @KamalaHarris and I need your help to make Donald Trump a one-term president. Sign up today and let’s get to work: https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS
We may be physically apart, but this week Democrats are coming together from across the nation to put forth our vision for a better America. #DemConvention Tune in tonight at 9 PM ET to join us: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/8pnGC9jrvd
The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better. We've got to create an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
As Attorney General of the largest state in the country, @KamalaHarris took on the big banks over mortgage fraud, and Big Oil when they wanted to pollute without consequences. She's the kind of fighter I need alongside me in the White House.
Here’s my promise to you: If I’m elected president, I will always choose to unite rather than divide. I’ll take responsibility instead of blaming others. I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.
Donald Trump and Congress need to act now to deliver the relief the American people need. https://t.co/YhlPXPspcS
The United States of America can be defined by one word: possibilities. There’s not a single thing we can’t achieve if we set our minds to it. https://t.co/vASpxmaD3E
I’m trying to get my miles in before the Secret Service stops me. https://t.co/2PFwO7bjSA
.@KamalaHarris is smart, tough, and experienced. She knows how to govern and make the hard calls. She's ready to hit the ground running on day one.
We need nationwide mask mandates.
Mr. President, Jill and I are sad to learn of your younger brother Robert’s passing. I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one — and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all.
We can meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. We just need a president and vice president ready and willing to lead. https://t.co/HqfHD0qB4y
.@KamalaHarris has spent her entire life fighting for what’s right — and I know she’ll continue that fight when we get to the White House. https://t.co/EgGuiaKKpC
William Perry Pendley has no business working at @blmnational and I'm happy to see his nomination to lead it withdrawn. In a Biden Administration, folks who spend their careers selling off public lands won't get anywhere near being tapped to protect them. https://t.co/a0GsuoCVpn
This was a big week for our campaign: @KamalaHarris joined me on the ticket and we had our best fundraising week yet. Together, we are building the coalition that will beat Donald Trump. Chip in if you’re able to keep the momentum going: https://t.co/MIxfjbChaW
I know a thing or two about being Vice President — and I know @KamalaHarris is the best partner I could have for the fight ahead.
Come January, there won’t be any time to waste repairing the damage of the last four years and beginning the work of building back better. @KamalaHarris and I are ready to get to work on day one. https://t.co/xEkEVwTHs6
Donald Trump has had a lot of failures in his career, but he knows how to do one thing well: inherit something great and squander it. And never take any responsibility. https://t.co/mDTSFogeUW
.@KamalaHarris' story is America's story. https://t.co/y871XVZlLX
We’ve got to protect and expand Social Security — I’ll get it done as President. https://t.co/hnkhh6I1ar
I know just how important Social Security is for countless Americans. That's why as president, I'll protect and strengthen it — not defund it.
This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I filled out our paperwork to get on the ballot in November. ow, we're counting on you to do your part to make sure you're set to vote. Get registered today: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M https://t.co/JzAonY8TCg
The fate of Social Security is on the ballot in November. As President, I will never, ever defund Social Security. I’ll strengthen it. Anything less is a failure of a president’s most important duty: to care for the American people. https://t.co/1GaFbdd6u7
People are losing their homes. Millions have already lost their paychecks. Our country is in crisis. The virus isn’t taking a break — Republicans shouldn’t either. The House did their job. President Trump, bring the Senate back and pass a relief bill. Now.
What kind of president tries to defund Social Security during an economic crisis? https://t.co/FO47IjABTF
Voting by mail is safe and secure. And don't take my word for it: Take it from the President, who just requested his mail-in ballot for the Florida primary on Tuesday.
Today marks 85 years since the Social Security Act was signed into law, providing protection for the most vulnerable. Now we’re living in a moment where we must strengthen our commitment to Social Security — not defund it.
The choice we make this November will decide the future of America. I have no doubt @KamalaHarris is the right partner to join me to lead our nation through this moment. https://t.co/YdJFksiCrI
