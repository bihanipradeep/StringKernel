Last night, @JimmyKimmel asked me what I thought of the Supreme Court hearings. I told him: this Republican effort to rip away health care should not be taking place. https://t.co/1Gu2DHTudp
I wrote a bill before Trump was sworn in to enforce the clause banning the President from taking foreign payments. I expanded it in my bill to #EndCorruptionNow. If the Court won't uphold the ban on these conflicts, Congress should do it and pass my bill. https://t.co/e9NAtITUC6
Yet another example of why Trump &amp; Republican senators are working hard to steal this Supreme Court seat: they want to hand the Court to extremists &amp; undermine our democracy. The judiciary absolutely should not approve the Trump administration's efforts to corrupt the Census. https://t.co/r7JkRA91pG
Last week, I released a report with @SenWhitehouse and others on the orchestrated right-wing effort to capture our courts for billionaires and giant corporations. Take a look at #WhatsAtStake if Barrett tips the courts against workers and consumers. https://t.co/PAhuANVu1w https://t.co/qFTf9g9Oi5
Amy Coney Barrett signed an ad calling Roe v Wade \"barbaric\" and spoke to anti-abortion groups. Now she won't say whether Roe was wrongly decided. Don't be fooled: Barrett has an agenda to get on the Court to overturn reproductive rights.
I'm going to keep saying this until I'm blue in the face: Presidents should not be able to own companies, hotels, and golf clubs on the side. It's corruption, plain and simple, and my bill to #EndCorruptionNow would end this bribery invitation. https://t.co/2p9Uwm7l2X
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a personal hero for me and millions of other women. Read my new @RollingStone piece on why we must honor Ruth's "fervent wish" and stop Donald Trump and the Senate Republicans from stealing this Supreme Court seat. https://t.co/3W0TIZfmrc
#IndigenousPeoplesDay is an opportunity for our country to celebrate the rich cultures, valuable contributions, &amp; remarkable resilience of Native communities. But as we celebrate, let our federal govt also commit to honoring its promises to all tribal nations &amp; Native peoples. https://t.co/AKFSVShpie
If today's Supreme Court hearings to steal a Supreme Court seat make you furious, get in the fight and make your voice heard. The power isn't just in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room right now – the power is with you.
This absurd hearing is happening today because Amy Coney Barrett is the last hope for a desperate, undemocratically overrepresented party trying to cling to power just a little longer, &amp; impose the agenda of billionaires, giant corporations, &amp; far-right extremists on our country.
Most Americans don't want the Supreme Court to take away abortion rights. Most Americans don't want the Supreme Court to rip away health care from millions of people. And most Americans believe that the next President should be filling this Supreme Court seat.
Senate Republicans know that Amy Coney Barrett will gut health care. That's why they're racing the clock to get her on the bench before the Supreme Court hears the case on November 10th that could deal the death blow to the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/EmSvrFVZLg
Senate Republicans know that Amy Coney Barrett is dedicated to overturning Roe v. Wade. That's why they're rushing this hearing without forcing Barrett to disclose her full anti-choice background, like her talks and support of anti-abortion groups. https://t.co/xSdsezYdjb
Today's sham hearing – on a holiday, 22 days from Election Day, during a COVID-19 outbreak in the Judiciary Committee with a likely-exposed Chairman who won't get tested – shows just how far the GOP will go to steal another Supreme Court seat &amp; hand our courts over to extremists.
If Trump rams through a Supreme Court nominee to repeal the ACA, the millions of Americans who have contracted COVID this year will have a new pre-existing condition that could raise their rates and jeopardize their health care. That's a fact. https://t.co/FczR8HaDV7
The American people deserve transparency into the health of our "Too Big to Fail" banks. And they deserve a real COVID-19 relief bill to help struggling families and small businesses, and stabilize our economy to prevent another Wall Street crash and taxpayer bailout.
Big banks take stress tests to make sure they won't bring down our economy. It's mind-blowing that the Fed is still allowing these banks to pay dividends to rich shareholders without a full picture of their readiness for a long recession.
In 2008, Wall St's recklessness brought our economy to its knees &amp; taxpayers got stuck with the bill. Fast forward 12 years to a recession, &amp; the Fed says some of those same big banks' planning for another crash \"has not been thoughtful." Are you kidding? https://t.co/0uuUcHgp7M
Too many Americans with disabilities already face barriers to quality health care. If Trump steals a Supreme Court seat to repeal the Affordable Care Act, programs and protections that help people live full, independent lives will be at risk. https://t.co/tOlsI4Z3pt
I don't know how you could read this heartbreaking story about Tin Aye and her family and not be furious about what's happening at giant meatpacking plants in our country – and the Trump administration's total unwillingness to hold them accountable. https://t.co/bEkqsDMVfi
Trump and the @SenateGOP are counting on us to sit back and stay quiet while our fundamental freedoms are on the line. But we see through their radical play. I wrote in @TheCut about what's at stake in this Supreme Court fight: https://t.co/zEE1Lqq4Cl
Amy Coney Barrett is the ticket for a desperate right-wing party that wants to hold onto power a little longer to impose its extremist agenda on the entire country. They nominated her to undermine health care and turn back the clock on reproductive rights. https://t.co/PYaprwUwLB
Trump knows the large majority of Americans don't support overturning Roe v. Wade. That's why he's suddenly tap-dancing after spending years promising to appoint anti-choice extremists. Trump knows that the GOP benefits when we stay on the sidelines. https://t.co/be443hfYA3
This is very good news for families in Massachusetts and across the country who have relied on school meals during this crisis. https://t.co/6BdWmAS3Y0
I was an original cosponsor of #SavannasAct when it was first introduced in 2017. I'm glad it &amp; the #NotInvisible Act – a pair of important bipartisan bills to address the crisis of murdered &amp; missing Indigenous women &amp; girls – are finally law. It's about time. #MMIWG https://t.co/MhA3wZKBd9
I'm glad that @SenJoniErnst agrees with what every rational person is saying right now, but talk is cheap. Will she skip the hearing or demand it be postponed if Chairman @LindseyGrahamSC or @ChuckGrassley refuse to take a test? No participation trophies for empty words. https://t.co/R4xLm8Iqbg
MA State Rep @IamJonSantiago is absolutely right about the disparities of care between the President and the patients who show up in his ER. We must "think about those who are least-served and most vulnerable." https://t.co/wUJhovZxTC
Many service jobs like office cleaning won't return until our government finally contains COVID-19. Black and Brown workers are being hit hardest. These families still need Congress to reinstate the $600 unemployment checks to help weather this crisis. https://t.co/1SRbwtVVgH
I released a plan for a national contact tracing program with @RepAndyLevin in April. Trump &amp; the @SenateGOP bungled this so badly that they can't even track cases in the White House. Enough is enough: we need to pass my bill to finally build this program. https://t.co/yqbaIRD0J5
Efforts by Trump or his advisors to silence, modify or delay science-based COVID-19 info from the FDA or CDC undermines their credibility &amp; independence. @SenGaryPeters, @PattyMurray &amp; I want @USGAO to investigate political interference at these agencies. https://t.co/TD49OVW6H1
We made a promise to students: go to college, get a degree, and get ahead. Student debt has broken that promise for too many Black Americans. The federal government can easily help close the racial wealth gap immediately if we #CancelStudentDebt. https://t.co/fuIoE7k4Qt
The 2008 crisis was a gut-punch to the financial lives of young people. Most never recovered. Now we seriously risk making the same mistakes during this crisis. If we #CancelStudentDebt, it will help prevent irreversible wealth loss in young Americans. https://t.co/PnfvUSHtQx
Huge numbers of Americans agree: instead of forcing student borrowers to keep signing over their paychecks the federal govt, we should #CancelStudentDebt and boost our economy by putting those monthly payments back into communities and small businesses. https://t.co/MEeC6pBvIc
The federal govt shares responsibility for our student debt crisis. Anyone whose family couldn't write a check for college got loaded up with debt AND charged high interest. But here's the good news: we can solve this problem if we #CancelStudentDebt. https://t.co/z4QNHoARoS
Too many Americans are struggling to find jobs and keep a roof over their heads during this pandemic. And student loans are a 1.5-trillion-pound weight on too many of their shoulders.\n\n@SenSchumer and I agree: The next President can and should #CancelStudentDebt. https://t.co/IV7AREcEKG
I'm about to join @PPAct President @AlexisMcGill on Instagram Live to discuss Trump's illegitimate Supreme Court nominee and our fight to protect health care and reproductive rights. Tune in now: https://t.co/eF4hZhCtVN
Congratulations to Cambridge's own Louise Glück for her well-deserved @NobelPrize in literature. I hope her poetry and teaching inspire generations of new poets in Massachusetts and across the country. Our Commonwealth is proud of you. https://t.co/gb0HDpKF2K
I don't have a problem with our tax-dodging President getting great medical care. I do have a problem with him trying to ram through a Supreme Court nominee who will overturn the ACA during the COVID crisis so struggling Americans can't get health care too. https://t.co/Bi3PdpJ8IO
Trump &amp; his right-wing buddies are desperate to overturn the ACA &amp; turn back the clock on reproductive rights. Amy Coney Barrett is their ideal nominee. Read my @TheCut piece on why we can't sit back while abortion &amp; birth control access are on the line. https://t.co/zEE1LqHG0V
My office contacted @ICEgov yesterday to find out whether its personnel were involved in this incident. I'm still waiting for an answer. People are rightly terrified of ICE &amp; this secrecy only makes things worse. I expect answers, &amp; our local, state &amp; federal officials do too. https://t.co/uJMY6VWRg6
For too long, giant tech companies have thrown around their weight to crush competition, exploit our data, and become even more powerful. This report is more evidence that Congress must rein in big tech to protect our economy, society, and democracy. https://t.co/iyURAMcYr1
People are struggling with addiction, and opioid overdoses have increased during COVID-19. President Trump should be working to fight this public health crisis – not ramming through a Supreme Court nominee to rip away mental health services by repealing the ACA.
4 years ago I passed a bipartisan bill to let patients partially fill opioid prescriptions so they don't pile up in medicine cabinets for family or friends to misuse. We want to know why @DEAHQ is still dragging its feet to fully implement this policy. https://t.co/kiZ4TfbGVU
I saw the cages of boys and girls ripped from their families. Mamas whose children were taken while they slept. Weeping women who said they could still hear babies cry at night. This report only begins to capture the administration's systematic cruelty. https://t.co/K1VPs0vdOC
Donald Trump has failed on every aspect of the COVID-19 response. He won't even try to be the leader our country needs during this crisis. Tonight I told the @MehdiHasanShow: this man is a menace to the health and safety of the American people. https://t.co/kWJK16HHfe
Predatory for-profit colleges have defrauded Black and Brown communities while their owners got filthy rich. @StudentLegalNet is right: @usedgov needs to end this boondoggle and use every tool available to hold these executives personally accountable. https://t.co/PiR55iyWMl
In the middle of the worst pandemic in a century, Trump won't help people get the relief they need – but he will ram through an illegitimate Supreme Court nominee to rip away Americans' health care. So much for the art of the deal. This is despicable. https://t.co/08kKOQfhER
I'm sure that everyone who is sick, out of work, going hungry, losing their homes, shuttering small businesses, or struggling in a zillion other ways during this pandemic is thrilled that you are hard at work to steal a Supreme Court seat for rich and powerful extremists. https://t.co/NtPkz0hrvo
Fed Chair Powell is absolutely correct: helping families, small businesses, and state and local governments is critical for our fragile economy. Trump, McConnell, and the Senate Republicans need to stop standing in the way of our economic recovery.  https://t.co/UOQF2qQnQZ
Too many people have already been exposed to COVID-19 from the GOP outbreak. Every senator who tested positive must follow CDC isolation guidelines. And they should publicly show 2 negative tests before getting on a plane, returning to the Capitol, &amp; putting more people at risk. https://t.co/o42Ugx0Htt
