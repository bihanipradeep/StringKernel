If "missing in action" means: traveling the country to meet with students and educators, talking with dozens of governors and local leaders, coordinating with the White House Coronavirus Task Force and CDC, and fighting for more funding for students. https://t.co/5h8woV8wew
Students need to keep learning &amp; parents need options. We can safely return to school &amp; meet the needs of every student. Thankful to @realDonaldTrump for hosting today's event &amp; elevating the voices of parents, teachers &amp; healthcare professionals committed to putting kids first. https://t.co/SAEmd0b2Sm
Education isn't about school buildings or school systems. It's about school children. They deserve to continue their education this fall in the ways and places that work for them. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/qTgvv1aoSa
President @realDonaldTrump and I stand with students and parents! They need real options for education this fall, tailored to meet the unique needs of each family. They need #SchoolChoiceNow. https://t.co/2PYRxbN2no
This Admin is committed to the success of #HBCUs, MSIs and the students they serve. Today's grant awards will help 17 of these institutions expand #STEM offerings so their students are prepared for the in-demand jobs of today &amp; tomorrow.\n\nLearn more here: https://t.co/iAVgE2r05V https://t.co/Go2WNDbDJf
"You deserve a choice to create the future that you see for yourself."  Kenya shares in her own words why all students need #SchoolChoiceNow. https://t.co/cwIPqC5g9p
Today's ruling on our #TitleIX rule out of the Southern District of New York is a true victory for students. So pleased to see the court agrees that civil rights cannot wait. https://t.co/OA20arj4Hy
Ashley says she's an advocate of #SchoolChoice because it changed her life, and she wants every student to have that same experience. President @realDonaldTrump and I stand with students like Ashley who want the freedom to choose where, when and how they learn. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/loj2WAgXOJ
The #COVID19 pandemic has made clear the antiquated one-size-fits-all approach to education is no longer tenable. Education going forward must be more adaptable and student-centered. It's time to unleash a new era of innovation &amp; drive unprecedented achievement. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/QsG53l9LCf
President @realDonaldTrump and I stand with these parents. They deserve in-person education options for their students. If their district school refuses to reopen, families should get the money for their child's education and use it to find the right fit. https://t.co/ZL5uiMdlJ0
"Their children are often in self-contained classrooms with just six students, and the parents believe there are ways to safely educate them offline, even if the entire student population isn't ready to go back."
"In the conversations about whether to reopen school buildings—or even how to shape virtual learning—parents of special education students fear that the unique needs of their children are not being urgently considered."
Ethan, a special ed student born w/ polymicrogyria has missed months of physical therapy and "has been angrier and more physically aggressive." His mother said that "if the computer isn't playing Sesame Street he slams the laptop down…It's been frustrating and a waste of time."
"And in Loudoun County, 8-year-old Theo Duran, who is autistic, struggles more to walk up the stairs or hold a crayon to write—all tasks he was making progress on before the coronavirus pandemic hit and shut down his school."
Some parents described virtual sessions as so ineffective that they just skipped them. Heinegg said for her son "It was extremely damaging to his self-esteem...I have spent years and lots of energy making sure he loves learning, and that was destroyed. How do you undo that?"
"Ayo Heinegg's son, a rising sixth-grader in the District with dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, is typically a high-performing student. But he struggled to keep up with his coursework on multiple online platforms and lost his confidence in the classroom."
Gibson said that "When school went virtual, it was hard to learn online—I had never done that before…I'm mad because I want to go to school. And I am hearing different days of when we go back to school. I miss my teachers, and I miss my friends."
Antwon Gibson's high school \"didn't even attempt to teach his ‘independent living' class virtually this spring. The gregarious 18-year-old has an intellectual disability and reads and performs math below grade level. He's been out of the classroom since schools closed in March…"
.@washingtonpost: "Parents across the country who have students w/ special ed needs say the stakes are high if schools do not reopen...children are not just falling behind academically...but missing developmental milestones &amp; losing key skills necessary for an independent life."
I've been called the \"School Choice Secretary\" by some. I think it's meant as an insult, but I wear it as a badge of honor. #COVID19 has laid bare there is no one-size-fits-all solution for education—it must be centered in what's best for students and families. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/T8xcfTNoXA
A majority of Americans support #SchoolChoice. Every family and child in America deserves the choice of where and how they pursue their education—regardless of income or zip code. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/qJO9oWCMWC
This is why @POTUS and I are fighting to put parents in charge of their children's education. Read the full article here: https://t.co/H1h21Rl5cJ
"We got a letter from the superintendent saying…more than 70% of parents surveyed…wanted...full in-person instruction or a hybrid model...the next paragraph says we're going full remote, which just struck me…as odd," said Doug Reed, a father of two.
A former High School teacher, Kathryn Rose said she understands why teachers are wary of returning to the classroom…but urged everyone to \"acknowledge and accept there are other bad outcomes without in-person instruction, like loss of learning and increased abuse and neglect\"
"@ChiPubSchools parent Nancy Curran said she's afraid her son Oliver…who is in a special ed program, will be ill-served by more remote learning if the city's schools don't reopen…she said online instruction is unrealistic &amp; frustrating for many students with special ed plans."
After learning District 65 is starting school w/ remote learning, Jessica Hockett decided to home-school her kids instead. "I had hoped they'd get the kids back in school at the start of the school year, even if it was some kind of hybrid choice.\"
Mairin Gradek's optimism that schools would reopen was buoyed by survey results: 75% of parents supported an in-person or hybrid plan. Remote learning trailed in 3rd place. But, recently, District 25 joined a list of school systems that have abandoned hopes of bringing kids back.
"Many parents say they feel like they're part of a silent majority, whose desire to have their children back in school has been pushed aside by school officials who are buckling to pressure from teachers unions." The @ChicagoTribune published several parent stories worth reading:
#SchoolChoice is about recognizing parents' inherent right to choose how and where their child is educated. This pandemic has made clear parents need that power now more than ever before. This administration will keep fighting until every family has #SchoolChoiceNow. https://t.co/HZdzxsV4po
Denisha is proof that #SchoolChoice works. Not only did it change the trajectory of her life, she's now an advocate who fights every day for students like her to have the same opportunity. Listen to her story in her own words. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/B0E6BgnxQw
President @realDonaldTrump and I trust parents. We believe in students. Each of them deserves the opportunity to go back to school this fall in the ways and places that will work best for them and their families. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/j6o3NbBW5d
The entire editorial is a MUST READ: https://t.co/4T4IdRGAsT 4/4
\"If there's a silver lining, it's...getting a closer look at the true...character of the unions. They are allies of the political left. And they wield monopoly power that they are using to coerce parents and taxpayers to dance to their agenda if they want children to learn.\" 3/4
The unions \"have a cynical interest in forcing their competitors to shut down. What a humiliation it would be if charter and private schools reopen and demonstrate that in-person education can be done...Or if parents...decide a private school would be better for their child.\" 2/4
.@WSJ editorial today: "Rather than work to open schools safely, the unions are issuing ultimatums and threatening strikes until they are granted their ideological wish list. Children, who would have to endure more lost instruction, are their hostages." 1/4
Walter explains why #SchoolChoice is "the great equalizer"—how it can not only break the cycle of poverty but truly change lives. This is why @SenatorTimScott's #SchoolChoiceNow Act is so important. ALL students deserve the same opportunity Walter had. https://t.co/cF9d89Hlbm
Congratulations to the many outstanding K-12 teachers and #STEM mentors recognized by @POTUS this year as #PAEMST and #PAESMEM awardees! Thank you for all you do to guide and support students in STEM!  https://t.co/bfI4VPukiD
Deborah felt like a quality education was out of reach for her son—that it was something reserved for only the rich and elite. A scholarship through #DCOSP was the catalyst that changed her son's life. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/zxX6PcClei
Great to be with @VP @Mike_Pence at @Thales_Academy! The students in Mrs. Combs' 4th Grade Class told me how much they missed their friends and how happy they are to be back together. This school has done tremendous work to safely reopen and get kids back to learning. https://t.co/ztxH9vuWZw
The #COVID19 pandemic has made clear now is the time to #RethinkEducation. @usedgov announced $180M+ in new grant funding for 11 states doing just that. Congrats LA, TN, RI, TX, IA, GA, SC, NY, NC, SD, ME on creating innovative ways to keep kids learning. https://t.co/pgMM6iZuKd
.@VP \"There has been no greater champion of #SchoolChoice...than @realDonaldTrump.\" We are committed to safely reopening schools &amp; doing what's right for students. If a school refuses to open, students need freedom to find one that will. #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/ffEOJKjals
As we mark #ADA30 this weekend, let us celebrate this landmark civil rights legislation and the progress we've made with an eye toward the next 30 years and our continued commitment to fostering accessibility, inclusion, and independence for students with disabilities. https://t.co/Yr1MezPPoz
Students like Tryphena are why I get up and go to work every day. President @realDonaldTrump and I will continue to fight for her and all students who need #SchoolChoiceNow. https://t.co/NfTx6X0pDU
Tyreke has a bright future ahead of him! Through #SchoolChoice he was able to attend a school that met his unique learning needs and is thriving because of it. Finding the right fit for his education has given him the courage to pursue his dreams. https://t.co/an6KiFmi2O
I am so proud of Walter Blanks and the advocate he's become for students and #SchoolChoice. His work to make sure other kids have the same opportunities he did is truly inspiring. Thank you for all you do, Walter! #SchoolChoiceNow https://t.co/r1nv4aTJ2d
#SchoolChoice is life changing. I want to thank all the students, parents and educators who came out in Columbus today to share your stories. President @realDonaldTrump and I stand with you and with every child in America who needs #SchoolChoiceNow. https://t.co/P4hcHELo9v
Thank you @SenatorTimScott, @SenAlexander for your tireless support of students and of President @realDonaldTrump's plan to provide #SchoolChoiceNow to students across America. This bill must be part of any relief package to help all students return safely to school in the fall. https://t.co/nl57L2HE3G
#DCOSP has connected 10K+ low-income families to life-changing educational opportunities. Today, @usedgov announced $85M to further support its mission. @POTUS and I will continue to fight to grow this program and expand #EducationFreedom for all students: https://t.co/gKfCfnQq9B https://t.co/VT08EvT6qH
A call to action from a mother in SC who says social isolation is taking a toll on her son who is diagnosed with Down syndrome. "As adults, it is our responsibility to find safe ways to resume an interactive learning environment…and choice must be at the center." #ReOpenSchools https://t.co/B9eCmP48tR
In SC today with Governor @henrymcmaster who knows students need to be able to safely return to school this fall and parents need options to make that happen. Thanks to his leadership, $32M in #CARESAct funds will go to low-income SC families to find the right fit this fall. https://t.co/h9HhciFCbo
