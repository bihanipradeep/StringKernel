Be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Wear a mask.
Our nation was founded on a simple idea: All men—and women—are created equal. We've never fully lived up to it, but we won't stop trying. As we mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, let's make sure we don't wait another 100 years to fulfill that founding promise.
Donald Trump still doesn't have a plan to get this virus under control. His failure to lead is costing American lives. Here's what I'll do as president: https://t.co/etpUGBkONZ https://t.co/aK3GjwG4vw
A good step forward. Yet President Trump continues to do everything he can to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. I will defend the rights of all Americans to have access to quality, affordable health care, free from discrimination. https://t.co/zOR0dXH1rt

Just imagine where we would be right now if we had a president who listened to the scientists.
Secretary Esper and President Trump, it's a president's job to protect the health and safety of our troops and their families. Gutting the military health care system — no less during a global pandemic — is unacceptable. https://t.co/lXpcSdm8au

The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better. We've got to create an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
As Attorney General of the largest state in the country, @KamalaHarris took on the big banks over mortgage fraud, and Big Oil when they wanted to pollute without consequences. She's the kind of fighter I need alongside me in the White House.
Here's my promise to you: If I'm elected president, I will always choose to unite rather than divide. I'll take responsibility instead of blaming others. I'll never forget that the job isn't about me — it's about you.
Donald Trump and Congress need to act now to deliver the relief the American people need. https://t.co/YhlPXPspcS

We need nationwide mask mandates.
Mr. President, Jill and I are sad to learn of your younger brother Robert's passing. I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one — and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all.
We can meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. We just need a president and vice president ready and willing to lead. https://t.co/HqfHD0qB4y
.@KamalaHarris has spent her entire life fighting for what's right — and I know she'll continue that fight when we get to the White House. https://t.co/EgGuiaKKpC
William Perry Pendley has no business working at @blmnational and I'm happy to see his nomination to lead it withdrawn. In a Biden Administration, folks who spend their careers selling off public lands won't get anywhere near being tapped to protect them. https://t.co/a0GsuoCVpn
This was a big week for our campaign: @KamalaHarris joined me on the ticket and we had our best fundraising week yet. Together, we are building the coalition that will beat Donald Trump. Chip in if you're able to keep the momentum going: https://t.co/MIxfjbChaW
I know a thing or two about being Vice President — and I know @KamalaHarris is the best partner I could have for the fight ahead.
Come January, there won't be any time to waste repairing the damage of the last four years and beginning the work of building back better. @KamalaHarris and I are ready to get to work on day one. https://t.co/xEkEVwTHs6

We've got to protect and expand Social Security — I'll get it done as President. https://t.co/hnkhh6I1ar
I know just how important Social Security is for countless Americans. That's why as president, I'll protect and strengthen it — not defund it.
This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I filled out our paperwork to get on the ballot in November. ow, we're counting on you to do your part to make sure you're set to vote. Get registered today: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M https://t.co/JzAonY8TCg
The fate of Social Security is on the ballot in November. As President, I will never, ever defund Social Security. I'll strengthen it. Anything less is a failure of a president's most important duty: to care for the American people. https://t.co/1GaFbdd6u7
People are losing their homes. Millions have already lost their paychecks. Our country is in crisis. The virus isn't taking a break — Republicans shouldn't either. The House did their job. President Trump, bring the Senate back and pass a relief bill. Now.
What kind of president tries to defund Social Security during an economic crisis? https://t.co/FO47IjABTF
Voting by mail is safe and secure. And don't take my word for it: Take it from the President, who just requested his mail-in ballot for the Florida primary on Tuesday.
Today marks 85 years since the Social Security Act was signed into law, providing protection for the most vulnerable. Now we're living in a moment where we must strengthen our commitment to Social Security — not defund it.
The choice we make this November will decide the future of America. I have no doubt @KamalaHarris is the right partner to join me to lead our nation through this moment. https://t.co/YdJFksiCrI

The hard truth is Black women still only get paid 62 cents for every dollar white men make. It's unacceptable. My administration will work to close the pay gap for Black women and create an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work. #BlackWomensEqualPayDay https://t.co/UTADOjULxF
I know @KamalaHarris will work every single day to make life better for all Americans and build this nation back better than before. https://t.co/8hTslszBPC
I first met @KamalaHarris through my son Beau. They grew close while fighting to take on the big banks — and he had enormous respect for her and her work. There is no one's opinion I valued more than Beau's, and I'm proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.

We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And if we're going to get through these crises — we need to come together and unite for a better America. @KamalaHarris gets that — and I believe there's no better person to help me get the job done.
When I called @KamalaHarris yesterday to ask her to be my running mate, I wanted to make sure Jill and Doug got to say hello. You're honorary Bidens now! https://t.co/IILUjB6WfY
Heather Heyer was a brave young woman who saw what was happening in her hometown of Charlottesville and decided to fight against it. Let us honor her memory by continuing to stand against hate.
Three years ago today, white supremacists descended on Charlottesville with torches in hand and hate in their hearts. Our president said they were "very fine people. " It was clear then, and it's clear now: We are in a battle for the soul of our nation, and we must win.
Let's get to work, @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/EjtUpgaieI
One of the reasons I chose @KamalaHarris is because we both believe you can define America in one simple word — possibilities.
If you're worried about whether you'll have a job, worried about the poisons in the air you breathe and water you drink, worried about your civil rights or even your basic dignity being under attack—@KamalaHarris has had your back. Now, we have to have hers.
Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don't have anyone on their side with this president. That's going to change in the Biden-Harris administration.
This morning, little girls woke up across this nation — especially Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — potentially seeing themselves in a new way: As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents.
We've all watched @KamalaHarris in the Senate go toe-to-toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that need to be asked — and not stopping until she gets an answer. She's ready to do this job.
This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I will be speaking together for the first time since yesterday's big announcement. Tune in: https://t.co/xoRbSqGta8
Whether it's taking on the big banks or pushing for marriage equality—Kamala never shies away from fighting tooth and nail for what's right. It's why I chose her to be my running mate. She'll wake up every day thinking about how to make life better for the people of our country.
As the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, @KamalaHarris grew up believing in the promise of America because she saw it firsthand. Together, Kamala and I are going to fight every single day in the White House to make sure that promise is fulfilled for all Americans.
If @KamalaHarris and I are elected, we're going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won't have a minute to waste. That's exactly why I picked her: She's ready to lead on day one.
.@KamalaHarris is the daughter of proud immigrants—a mother from India and a father from Jamaica—who raised her to take action. That's exactly what this moment calls for: action. And we hope you'll take action with us: https://t.co/K3mVwfTxXJ https://t.co/MZLAx9IN6C
Right now, America faces: - The worst pandemic in 100 years - The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression - The most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation I need someone alongside me who's smart, tough, and ready to lead. @KamalaHarris is that person.
Thanks to supporters like you, we are on track to have our biggest fundraising day ever. Together, we can win this. Join us. https://t.co/B7uyMcat6n
Let's go win this, @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/O2EYo6rYyk
Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.
I have the great honor to announce that I've picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country's finest public servants — as my running mate.
Don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the Trump Administration is in court trying to eliminate Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's heartless. I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need. https://t.co/IwFG48ED9h
I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control. I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward. We'll get it done, together.
This is the latest dire consequence of Donald Trump looking the other way on Beijing's repression in Hong Kong. Instead of standing for freedom and democracy, he consistently stands with Xi Jinping. I'll put American values back at the center of our foreign policy. https://t.co/3RAZOeVtHr
Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement — giving countless Americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity. I've been fighting to protect and expand the program throughout my career — and I'll continue that fight as president.
Folks, we need to listen to our frontline heroes. Wear a mask. It's not just about you. It's about keeping your family, neighbors, and fellow citizens safe. https://t.co/pbI6UVhqvh
Bristol Bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO. https://t.co/RG38v0dRDk
Donald Trump said that if he's re-elected, he'll defund Social Security. We can't let that happen.
President Trump keeps attacking the U.S. Postal Service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. It's despicable. I promise you that as president, I will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans. https://t.co/aXryhxVRtG
Donald Trump's surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans. After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do: https://t.co/SOVOPL7uPy
To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now — those who can't find a job or pay the bills: I want you to know that I see you, and I won't forget you — and I'm going to fight every day in the White House to build an economy that works for you.
Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump — then it's good enough for you and me.
We can't let Donald Trump destroy the U.S. Postal Service.
It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson — reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.
Our planet can't take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.
Giving the Trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations. His victory would threaten the future of our democracy, and we must vote him out this November. https://t.co/iIFPTIB1Er
The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It's a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn't have gotten this bad.
Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security. Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt. https://t.co/glUDQlcbEO
Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he's always wanted — the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world. https://t.co/owvNL4ul74
It's an important choice, and I want you to be one of the first to know who I've picked as my running mate – text FIRST to 30330 to get notified when I've made my decision.
Between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, I know. But I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. Together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before.
The fact is, Donald Trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime — and we're paying the price every single day. https://t.co/sZJCdivRo3
Our nation is desperate for leadership — leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. But at the most critical moment of his presidency, Donald Trump has nothing to offer.
No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I'll promise you this: when I'm President we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.
John Lewis will be remembered as a moral giant who dedicated his life to creating a more just, equal, and moral America. Donald Trump will not. https://t.co/vfZFeCUX3S
I can't believe I have to say this, but we can't let Donald Trump open up the Grand Canyon for uranium mining.
I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That's why as president, I'll reverse Donald Trump's giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone.
It didn't have to be this bad. https://t.co/xwdxgizLLH
Here's the truth—Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans. It's time we pick a different path. https://t.co/rt5RD9WOGA
Make no mistake: This economic crisis is due to President Trump's failure to get this virus under control. https://t.co/CBbk6SV39Q
While I am grateful for the people who got their jobs back, my heart goes out to the more than 16 million Americans still out of work. The truth is it didn't have to be this bad, but Donald Trump failed to act. He's the one person who should lose his job. https://t.co/eIHGRjwJd3
The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic—it's obvious he still hasn't learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price. https://t.co/JOgA5Gpop4
Here's how COVID-19 affected Arizonans under the Trump—Ducey model: - An infection rate—still—of nearly 20% - The fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country - More than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19 - More than 183,000 cases - Lengthy delays in test results
Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing. He's withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it. He's refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older Americans and those at greater risk.
President Trump called Arizona "a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown." He said Governor Ducey's approach should be used by other states—but here's what's really happening in Arizona:
My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.
Throughout my career I've witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the African American community. It's this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place.
Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith—not by identity, not on issues, not at all.
I believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. To protect it, we've got to: - Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act - Enact automatic and same-day voter registration - Stand up to Republican voter suppression efforts
John Lewis left us with marching orders. It's up to all of us to carry them out: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M https://t.co/MTc6WHNnSR
Every moment with your loved ones is precious. I know that in my core because I've learned it through loss. It's why as president, I'm going to do everything I can to get this virus under control and get our lives back to normal as soon as we can. https://t.co/qCsvryHMai
Let me be clear: Voting is a right — not a privilege. Anyone who tells you otherwise can't be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.
The fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place. It's why I fought for and helped secure a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act. And it's why as president, I'll immediately sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act into law. https://t.co/fHqUvYahRR
55 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law — bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. As we mark its anniversary, we've got to continue our fight to restore the VRA and protect the sacred right to vote.
The scenes of death and destruction from Hiroshima and Nagasaki still horrify us 75 years later. They reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict—and our collective responsibility to ensure they're never again used. https://t.co/357jRzBPeL

Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs, but his policies crushed the manufacturing sector—and that was true even before COVID-19. I'll revitalize American manufacturing and innovation and create millions of good-paying jobs so we can build back better. https://t.co/HrOOkWWQof
Growing up in Scranton, I learned the importance of hard work, treating others with dignity and respect, and leaving no one behind. Those values have guided my entire life — and they're the values I'll bring back to the White House. https://t.co/aelfrxaISg
Folks, a lot of you have been asking when I'm announcing my running mate, and I promise I'll let you know soon. But here's what I can tell you right now: I'm going to tell my supporters first — so text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know.
I don't buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. As president, I'll make bold investments in American manufacturing, industry, and innovation to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America. https://t.co/LkIi8g6M5i
There's been a lot of talk about my vetting process lately. Here's an inside look: https://t.co/tFRKJOE3hi
Weapons of war have no place in our communities. When I was a senator, I took on the @NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons — and as president, I'll ban these weapons again. https://t.co/ggqSaj40EJ
Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI — ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence.
I truly believe that we can revitalize American manufacturing and create a better economy at the same time. I want to build an economy that brings everyone along — one that works for the middle class, not just the wealthy and well-connected. https://t.co/3fYbFfsvDb
The truth of the matter is, Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it. https://t.co/EPxDx4ecoU
From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action. ow, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership.
On day one, I'll send a bill to Congress creating a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11 million undocumented people already strengthening our nation. It's long overdue. https://t.co/ajO7uUb9po
Our hearts and prayers are with the people of Lebanon, and the victims of the horrific explosion in Beirut. I urge both the Trump Administration and international community to immediately mobilize assistance to the thousands injured in the blast.

The Latino community is bearing disproportionate harm from this pandemic. But even before, many Latino families were already struggling. We've got to do better. That's why today, I'm releasing my new agenda for the Latino community: https://t.co/xgGUoleGQO
As president, I'll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We can and will end our gun violence epidemic.
One year ago, just hours after the massacre in El Paso, nine precious lives were cut short in Dayton. In the wake of the tragedies, Donald Trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the @NRA and failed to deliver.
On July 1st, Donald Trump predicted the coronavirus was going to "just disappear. " He was wrong — and more than 25,000 Americans died due to the virus last month. Mr. President, step up and do your job before even more American families feel the pain of losing a loved one.
When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. Period. We're going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America: https://t.co/uTI6GyuTpX

This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. A battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence. It won't be easy — but it's a battle we must win.
One year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of El Paso. He thought his hatred of Latinos and immigrants would prove more powerful than the culture and vibrancy of the community. He was wrong. https://t.co/d7ISze6dK7
Folks, there's simply too much at stake this November for anyone to sit on the sidelines. Register to vote today — and then reach out to five friends and get them registered as well. https://t.co/8XWNjhwJzL
Welcome home, Bob and Doug! The first American splashdown in 45 years was executed with precision, and is truly a victory for American innovation and persistence. Congratulations to everyone involved on a successful conclusion to this historic mission. https://t.co/kYBNCHL75O
Join us as we host a roundtable with Congresswoman Veronica Escobar to commemorate the anniversary of the El Paso Massacre: https://t.co/LPA5wDYvNF
It's not enough to just go back to the way things were before these crises — we need to build back better than ever. We have to create a new American economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.
Now more than ever, we need a president who believes in science.
This pandemic has put a bright light on the disparities that have plagued our nation for too long. We've got to make sure these communities get the help they need now — and root out the systemic racism that created these inequalities in the first place. https://t.co/KZZx2T9ojT
Enhanced unemployment benefits expired for millions overnight. We don't have an effective nationwide testing program or a plan to control the virus. Our health care workers still don't have enough PPE. Enough with the weekend golf trips, Mr. President. Do your job.
Rent is due today. Donald Trump abdicated his responsibility to lead us out of this COVID-19 crisis—and we now face a potential housing crisis because of it. Mr. President: Act now to make sure Americans don't have to choose between a roof over their heads or food on the table. https://t.co/b0Uoy5qoFr
You have enough on your plate — you shouldn't also have to worry about the president making things even tougher for you. https://t.co/HjwhG8kQMT
If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of this nation. We can't let that happen.
To the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country run: I see you, and I promise I will never stop fighting for you. You are the backbone of America. https://t.co/009KRZx9Bq
Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and it's being written every day by folks like Dr. @Craig_A_Spencer, who fought the Ebola outbreak and now COVID-19. @BarackObama and I called to thank him for his service and discuss the moment we're in. https://t.co/wO14pwaaxa
Folks, we're just a few hours away from our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline. We need everyone to step up so we can hit our goal and make sure we can go toe-to-toe with President Trump. If you're able, please chip in today: https://t.co/XAsy8zaW2v
Jill and I are keeping everyone in the path of Hurricane Isaias in our prayers. We must ensure that our fellow Americans, in Puerto Rico and across the East Coast, get the support they need. Please heed the warnings from authorities, take steps to prepare, and stay safe. https://t.co/Jb6AYJ4o0Q
Together, we're going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America. https://t.co/HX4zat4BVK
Grassroots donations are the backbone of our campaign — and we want to thank you for all your help. So tonight, Senator @ewarren and I are hosting an event that you won't want to miss. Chip in to reserve your spot: https://t.co/KUyaCEAUi8 https://t.co/TiQzQ8tba7
We're facing some of the biggest challenges in our history — and it's abundantly clear Donald Trump just isn't up for the job. We need real leadership — and we need it now.
It's been over six months since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States, and President Trump still doesn't have an effective plan to contain its spread. It's an unjustifiable failure of leadership that costs lives every day.
.@DrBiden and I wish all our Muslim friends and neighbors a blessed #EidAlAdha. May your sacrifices on this day be accepted and strengthen you during these challenging times. Eid Mubarak!
Human trafficking is an unconscionable attack on the dignity of the most vulnerable among us. Action can't wait — on this World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, we've got to join together and commit to ending trafficking. #EndHumanTrafficking https://t.co/5UJHwaMRQI
You won't have to worry about my tweets when I'm president.
Bill Barr is the Attorney General of the United States — not the president's private attorney. https://t.co/XVfyErCZu9
55 years ago today, Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law. And ever since, they've extended lives, enhanced liberty, and put the pursuit of happiness within reach for millions. I'll protect and expand these programs for generations to come. https://t.co/haLz46TAOD
Throughout his life, John Lewis taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up. It's up to all of us to carry on his mission. https://t.co/VUJdegsBuw
It's time Senate Republicans back their effusive praise of John Lewis with action. Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.
Even after his passing, John Lewis reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make real the promise of our nation. May his words guide us as we march on toward November. https://t.co/wmxgIqDDAi
The last three months were the worst period for economic growth our nation has experienced in the 70 years since we started measuring it — a drop of nearly 33 percent. Let's be clear: This is no act of God, it's a failure of presidential leadership. https://t.co/pPZXkHtJcR
I'm the proud husband of a teacher. I've seen firsthand how difficult the job can be in normal times — let alone in the middle of a pandemic. So when I heard Beth's story, I knew @BarackObama and I had to give her a call. https://t.co/xBdeItoMW6
Donald Trump's instinct to constantly add fuel to the fire is the last thing our country needs right now. We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. https://t.co/tNUQUYDO8P
We need a president who will bring us together instead of tearing us apart and who will enforce the law faithfully rather than put his own political interests first. https://t.co/SL7dojwyDi
Folks, I'm excited to share that Senator @ewarren and I are hosting a grassroots fundraiser this Friday — and you're invited. We're going to chat about what's at stake this November and even answer a few of your questions. Chip in any amount to join us: https://t.co/Ak0FXcwfoV https://t.co/j6OGUieI46
Donald Trump has shown that he can't beat the pandemic or turn the economy around. And he is unsurprisingly stoking the flames of division for political gain. He is the worst possible person to lead our nation through this moment. https://t.co/CfJzEwU6Cm
My heart goes out to Jessica and the countless others across the nation who have lost a loved one due to COVID-19. Behind every number we see in the news is a family and community that will never again be whole — and we can't forget that. https://t.co/S2NrhkXrHI
Congratulations to California Child Care Providers United on a successful election. As president, I'll make it easier for child care workers to unionize — and I'll provide resources so they earn higher wages while also making care more affordable. #ChildCareIsEssential https://t.co/49zAdq9Mte
We need an effective, coordinated nationwide testing and tracing program. We need more PPE for health care workers. We need a comprehensive plan to get this virus under control. We need this president to do his job.
I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is. But I'm optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country. There is nothing we're unable to achieve when we do it together.
Listen to the scientists: Wear a mask. https://t.co/9CFioW4wvS
Donald Trump voted by mail. You should be able to as well.
Small business ownership is one of our country's cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. But Black and Brown entrepreneurs face far too many barriers to ownership, growth, and success. I've got a plan to change that: https://t.co/27Y38un2tM https://t.co/MF7OpMS7bA
America has never lived up to our founding promise — and we can't rest until we finally do. My new plan will advance racial equity across the American economy and bring us closer to reaching our highest ideals: https://t.co/27Y38u5rCe https://t.co/pQGZ78PXwC
My housing plan will give a $15,000 tax credit to first-time home-buyers, expand affordable housing, and reverse President Trump's efforts to gut fair housing enforcement. We're going to remove the barriers to homeownership that hold back too many Americans of color.
To support more Black and Brown small businesses, my administration will launch a new Small Business Opportunity Initiative. We're going to make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code.
In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back. We have to break the cycle, and I've got a plan to do it: https://t.co/27Y38un2tM
This election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It's about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people's struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome.
A change of "tone" over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years. Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president: the duty to care about the entire country, not just his re-election prospects.
The Senate and this President should pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act — renamed yesterday in memory of John Lewis. If they don't, it will be one of the first things I do as president.
I'm in Wilmington, Delaware, to unveil the fourth plank of my Build Back Better plan. Tune in as I discuss what my administration will do to advance racial equity in our economy: https://t.co/NTZviQqUX5
In this moment, we have the chance to build an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. One more vibrant and more powerful because everyone is in on the deal. Here's how we'll do it: https://t.co/27Y38un2tM https://t.co/d0kM3yyglS
We can't build this nation back better without tackling the systemic racism and disparities that have plagued our country for far too long. That's why today, I'm releasing my new plan to advance racial economic equity across the American economy. https://t.co/MQW8ItM0J8
Our students and educators deserve better than four more years of Betsy DeVos. It's time for a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator. https://t.co/rUVThAQ24K
John — march on, dear friend. May God bless you. And may you continue to inspire righteous good trouble down from the Heavens. https://t.co/lqg9SGxYNE
Tonight, Jill and I are thinking about the 150,000 families left emptier by this virus. To anyone who's struggling, sick, or wondering how they'll get through the day: know that I will not abandon you. We'll fight through this crisis together, and emerge stronger than ever.
Arianna's a supporter of our campaign who's been organizing food drives for her community during the COVID crisis. My team told me about her work, so @BarackObama and I decided to surprise her with a call. https://t.co/GnwvU6HMld
The development of a new vaccine requires a dedication to science, coordination, transparency, truth, and fairness to all — and we have a President who stands for none of these things. https://t.co/38t303Fknw
These policies aren't just the right thing to do — they're also the smart thing to do for the future of our country. https://t.co/zoXsJ2PbXG
Women-owned small businesses like Marsh + Mane are the backbone of communities across the nation. We have got to do more to invest in and support them. Here's what I'll do as president: https://t.co/EUs7NyzOEe https://t.co/bhRSHXQVGs
The hard truth is women — and particularly women of color — have never had a fair shot to get ahead in this country. That's why today, I'm releasing my plan to make sure women can fully participate in our economy and country. https://t.co/vUWUanQAR0
The hard truth is this pandemic didn't have to be this bad. Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control: https://t.co/cw8mBOfujj
In 100 days, we're going to make Donald Trump a one-term president. https://t.co/vTrPRrHhwm

As Hurricane Hanna makes landfall, Jill and I are sending our prayers to the people of South Texas. We must ensure that affected residents get the support they need — and get it quickly. If you are in an impacted region, please heed the advice of local officials and seek shelter.
I know firsthand how hard it can be to take care of an aging family member. It's why as president, I'll ease the financial burden on families and expand access to dignified care for older Americans. https://t.co/Z8FOorRgLe
No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet. We have to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and build an inclusive middle class that brings everyone along.
There is no quit in America — and you deserve a president who won't quit on you.
President Trump ordered his administration to slow down coronavirus testing, he tried to block CDC funding, and he has ignored the experts from day one. His actions defy both logic and humanity. What kind of president actively undercuts efforts that will save lives?
Every American family deserves access to affordable, high-quality child care. Here's how I'll make that happen: https://t.co/Z8FOorRgLe https://t.co/4woudaAGqo
I know times are tough, but I want you to know you're not alone. We're all in this fight together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before.
The President has a duty to care for us all. To see people where they are and to understand what they're going through. I've been a single parent. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of folks going through tough times, I know how hard it is. https://t.co/7JlGjvUcqd
This is the United States of America. We don't settle — we aspire. Let's get to work.
The hard truth is that we can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better. President @BarackObama and I discussed how we can do that, and much more: https://t.co/DBqIS5IoN3
Our nation is at a crossroads. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's divisive politics and failed leadership — or we can forge a new path forward. https://t.co/CHbtVP8IaV
Home care workers and child care workers — who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants — have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long. That will change with my administration: https://t.co/RbUFxJ3CYS
Donald Trump's own staff admits that he fails the most important test of being the American President: the duty to care — for you, for all of us. https://t.co/mJf0xhEYZ5
We need a president who listens to someone other than himself.
This was preventable. https://t.co/NWaHXW8U4K
Out of every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger as a nation — and we will again. If we come together, there is not a single thing we cannot accomplish. https://t.co/khTCfexgbX
Hey @Phillies, here's to hoping we both win big this fall. Stay safe. #OpeningDay https://t.co/nGtdDVsrXv
COVID-19 infections are going up. The number of deaths is going up. This morning it was announced that, once again, the number of unemployment claims is going up. Donald Trump is moving us backwards. The American people are paying the price.
Care jobs are ready to be filled right now, allowing millions of people — primarily women — to get back to work immediately. It's the right thing to do for our families and our essential workers — and it's the smart thing to do for our economy. https://t.co/l598dnBp0O
Folks, I sat down with my friend President @BarackObama to discuss the significant moment we're in, who we are as a nation, and how we can build back better. Watch our full conversation: https://t.co/n2P71Le1oH
Every day I hear from folks who tell me how important health care is to their families — well, it's deeply personal for President @BarackObama and me, too. I'll fight to protect and build on Obamacare and make sure everyone gets the care they need. Watch our conversation: https://t.co/ZyrBmLrjCJ
Let me be clear: If vote-by-mail is good enough for Donald Trump and his administration, then it's good enough for all of us. https://t.co/0qQW9ff0eG
I know everything feels different right now. There's just that feeling where you don't know if everything will be okay. But I promise you that it can be and it will be. https://t.co/rax3jyH8hq
Today, the House passed the #NoBanAct because no one should be discriminated against or singled out based on the faith they practice. I will end President Trump's Muslim Ban on day one and sign this bill into law.
My plan to create a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce will put 3 million Americans to work — and free up millions more people to join the paid labor force. It's a fresh, bold approach that will help us recover faster and stronger. https://t.co/nxpwi93TEp
The goal of the Census is clear: count every person. But Donald Trump continues to use this vital process to sow division and scare immigrant communities. We won't let him deny communities the funding and representation they deserve. Because in America, everyone counts. https://t.co/7ScczXykra
The words of a president matter. And from the moment President Trump came down that escalator, he has used his to degrade people and sow division. It's not who we are. Watch my full conversation with President @BarackObama tomorrow at 10 AM ET. https://t.co/hFRbz1kfcc
Today, we're facing a serious threat — and we have to meet it together as one country. It's up to all of us to do everything we can to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy. https://t.co/97Td2QvmAG

10 years ago the Obama-Biden Administration signed Wall Street reform to prevent the abuse that led to the Great Recession. Donald Trump and the Republicans have tried to tear it down ever since. As president, I'll protect it so we can rebuild an economy that works for everyone.
For your family, for your neighbors, for your country — wear a mask.
Happy Birthday, Congressman Clyburn! Your powerful voice of moral clarity never fails to steer us toward a better future — and reminds us all of why we're in public service in the first place. I'm grateful for your leadership and honored to call you a friend. https://t.co/Rtv34FpQAI
Let me say what President Trump won't: Russian interference in our elections is a violation of our sovereignty. And if I'm president, I'll respond accordingly. https://t.co/ZvkU7bbJ3r
Home health workers do God's work, but aren't paid much. They have few benefits, and 40% are still on SNAP or Medicaid. It's unacceptable. I'll give caregivers and early childhood educators a much-needed raise.
