Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which cameinto Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, andBenjamin,  Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increasedabundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land
was filled with them.Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children ofIsrael are more and mightier than we: 1:10 Come on, let us deal wisely
with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when therefalleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fightagainst us, and so get them up out of the land.Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom andRaamses.But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied andgrew.
And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve withrigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, inmorter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all
their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which thename of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 Andhe said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and
see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: butif it be a daughter, then she shall live.But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egyptcommanded them, but saved the men children alive.
And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said untothem, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men childrenalive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrewwomen are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are
delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the peoplemultiplied, and waxed very mighty.And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
made them houses.And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that isborn ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall savealive.
And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife adaughter of Levi.And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him thathe was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark ofbulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the childtherein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at theriver; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when shesaw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the
babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of theHebrews’ children.Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call tothee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for
thee?  2:8 And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid wentand called the child’s mother.And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, andnurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took
the child, and nursed it.And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter,and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,Because I drew him out of the water.
And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that hewent out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spiedan Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there
was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of theHebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee a
prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thoukilledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thingis known.Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:and he sat down by a well.Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came anddrew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood upand helped them, and watered their flock.And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it thatye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered
us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough forus, and watered the flock.And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it thatye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave MosesZipporah his daughter.And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for hesaid, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egyptdied: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, andthey cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respectunto them.Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest
of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, andcame to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire outof the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned
with fire, and the bush was not consumed.And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,why the bush is not burnt.And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto
him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,Here am I.And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thyfeet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for hewas afraid to look upon God.And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people
which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of theirtaskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down todeliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them upout of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing
with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and theHittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, andthe Jebusites.Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come
unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptiansoppress them.Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thoumayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be atoken unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth
the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children ofIsrael, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent meunto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say
unto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent meunto you.And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this ismy name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,
The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and ofJacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seenthat which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bringyou up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,
and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and theHivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thouand the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say
unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let usgo, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that wemay sacrifice to the LORD our God.And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not
by a mighty hand.And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all mywonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he willlet you go.
And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her thatsojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon yourdaughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believeme, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not
appeared unto thee.And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And hesaid, A rod.And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,
and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it bythe tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became arod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their
fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,hath appeared unto thee.And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand intothy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it
out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put hishand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.
And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of thetabernacle of the congregation, saying, 1:2 Speak unto the children ofIsrael, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering untothe LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the
herd, and of the flock.If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer amale without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; andit shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood roundabout upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation.And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,
and lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 And the priests, Aaron’ssons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon thewood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 But his inwards
and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all onthe altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of asweet savour unto the LORD.
And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or ofthe goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male withoutblemish.
And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward beforethe LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his bloodround about upon the altar.
And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the firewhich is upon the altar: 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the
legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it uponthe altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of asweet savour unto the LORD.
And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be offowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of youngpigeons.
And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off hishead, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrungout at the side of the altar: 1:16 And he shall pluck away his crop
with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, bythe place of the ashes: 1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wingsthereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it
upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burntsacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his
offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, andput frankincense thereon: 2:2 And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sonsthe priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour
thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be anoffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: 2:3 And the
remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is athing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, orunleavened wafers anointed with oil.And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be
of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meatoffering.
And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, itshall be made of fine flour with oil.And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these
things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, heshall bring it unto the altar.And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made byfire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and
his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD madeby fire.No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in anyoffering of the LORD made by fire.As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto
the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season withsalt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to
be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shaltoffer salt.And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits greenears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it
is a meat offering.And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beatencorn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense
thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offerit of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it

And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food ofthe offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is theLORD’s.
It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughoutall your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 4:2 Speak unto the children
of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against anyof the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not tobe done, and shall do against any of them: 4:3 If the priest that is
anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bringfor his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemishunto the LORD for a sin offering.
And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon thebullock’s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.
And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood,and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:6 And the priestshall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven
times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of thealtar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of
the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at thebottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of thetabernacle of the congregation.
And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for thesin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat thatis upon the inwards, 4:9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon
them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with thekidneys, it shall he take away, 4:10 As it was taken off from thebullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn

Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after theirfamilies, by the house of their fathers, according to the number ofthe names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go

Of the children of Asher, by their generations, after theirfamilies, by the house of their fathers, according to the number ofthe names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go

tribe of Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaronnumbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each one was
for the house of his fathers.So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel,by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all
that were able to go forth to war in Israel; 1:46 Even all they thatwere numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and fivehundred and fifty.
But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were notnumbered among them.For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying, 1:49 Only thou shalt
not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among thechildren of Israel: 1:50 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over thetabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over
all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and allthe vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encampround about the tabernacle.
And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall takeit down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shallset it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man byhis own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout theirhosts.
But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle oftestimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of thechildren of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the
tabernacle of testimony.And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORDcommanded Moses, so did they.
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 2:2 Everyman of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, withthe ensign of their father’s house: far off about the tabernacle of
the congregation shall they pitch.And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they ofthe standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies: and
Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of the children ofJudah.And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe ofIssachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of the
children of Issachar.And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty andfour thousand and four hundred.
Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon shall becaptain of the children of Zebulun.And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and
seven thousand and four hundred.All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundredthousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred,
throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reubenaccording to their armies: and the captain of the children of Reuben
shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fortyand six thousand and five hundred.
These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this sideJordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea,between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.(There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount
Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)  1:3 And it came to pass in the fortiethyear, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Mosesspake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD
had given him in commandment unto them; 1:4 After he had slain Sihonthe king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king ofBashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 1:5 On this side Jordan, in
the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 1:6 TheLORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enoughin this mount: 1:7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the
mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in theplain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the seaside, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great
river, the river Euphrates.Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the landwhich the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to
give unto them and to their seed after them.And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bearyou myself alone: 1:10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and,
behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so manymore as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)  1:12 How can
I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among yourtribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken isgood for us to do.So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made
them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains overhundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, andofficers among your tribes.
And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causesbetween your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and hisbrother, and the stranger that is with him.
Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear thesmall as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you,
bring it unto me, and I will hear it.And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye shoulddo.
And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that greatand terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain ofthe Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to
Kadeshbarnea.And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of theAmorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.
Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up andpossess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fearnot, neither be discouraged.
And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will sendmen before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring usword again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall
come.And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, oneof a tribe: 1:24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and
came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, andbrought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a
good land which the LORD our God doth give us.Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against thecommandment of the LORD your God: 1:27 And ye murmured in your tents,
and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out ofthe land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, todestroy us.
Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are greatand walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the
Anakims there.Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,
according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 1:31And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy Godbare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,
until ye came into this place.Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 1:33 Whowent in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your
tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, andin a cloud by day.And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
sware, saying, 1:35 Surely there shall not one of these men of thisevil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto yourfathers.
Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him willI give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children,because he hath wholly followed the LORD.
Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou alsoshalt not go in thither.But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall
go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, andyour children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and
evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and theyshall possess it.But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
wilderness by the way of the Red sea.Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against theLORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God
commanded us.And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were readyto go up into the hill.
And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neitherfight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against
the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out againstyou, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto
Hormah.And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would nothearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.
So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that yeabode there.Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the
way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mountSeir many days.And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 2:3 Ye have compassed this
mountain long enough: turn you northward.And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through thecoast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and
they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselvestherefore: 2:5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of theirland, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount
Seir unto Esau for a possession.Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shallalso buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thyhand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: theseforty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked
nothing.And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from
Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neithercontend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land
for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot fora possession.The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many,
and tall, as the Anakims; 2:11 Which also were accounted giants, asthe Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them,and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of hispossession, which the LORD gave unto them.
Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And wewent over the brook Zered.And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were
come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all thegeneration of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, asthe LORD sware unto them.
