Unlike President Trump, Iâ€™ll be a president for all Americans â€” not just the ones who vote for me. #BidenTownHall pic.twitter.com/2lttWNRl5n
Here's the deal: I've condemned every form of violence, no matter what the source is. President Trump has not. #BidenTownHall pic.twitter.com/kqoaJRLYMn
As president, I will bring Americans together and finally deliver much needed policing reform. #BidenTownHall pic.twitter.com/7iwYuXOS2p

I'll tell you what takes away your freedom: not being able to see your kid, go to the football game, or see your mom or dad in the hospital. That's what is costing us our freedom. #BidenTownHall pic.twitter.com/YM57H8lv2K
or many Granite Staters, keeping a roof over their heads has been a tremendous challenge over the course of this pandemic. This funding will help those most vulnerable in our society access the affordable housing they need to stay safe and secure. unionleader.com/news/homes/staâ€¦
This is an unacceptable answer. NHâ€™s nursing homes need support NOW to protect residents and the Trump administration is withholding most of the resources Congress has provided. The public deserves answers! pic.twitter.com/qyb3FaEB90
34% of NH high schoolers have reported vapingâ€“ an alarming figure, especially amid reports that vaping & smoking increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. That's why I've introduced a bill to hold e-cig companies accountable for targeting kids & will keep pushing the admin to act. twitter.com/laconiadailysuâ€¦
Having obstructed bipartisanship for months, @senatemajldr tried to jam a COVID response bill through the Senate that was woefully inadequate & ignored the challenges NH faces. Time is running outâ€“ the Senate must pass meaningful relief legislation & should not recess until then. pic.twitter.com/G3yvzaR8eT
Keeping those who tested positive in my thoughts and hoping for a full recovery. My office is in contact with Shipyard officials and will continue to monitor the situation. Every measure must be taken to ensure the safety of our Shipyard workers and their families. twitter.com/WMUR9/status/1â€¦
From the beginning of our nationâ€™s history, Granite Staters have selflessly answered the call of duty to protect our country and tragically, some never return home. We have a solemn obligation to always honor the memory of Staff Sergeant Ouellette and hold his family close.
Pleased to announce $2M in DOJ funding for @UofNH studies that will bolster law enforcement efforts against child sex trafficking, ensure survivors receive the care they need & fight cyber abuse, which is a serious & growing problem among young people. shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/nh-â€¦
Combating sexual violence requires training & education to prevent violence before it occurs & to empower peers to step in if they suspect someone is unsafe. These funds will make investments in @SoteriaSol to develop programs to enhance school safety. shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/shaâ€¦

The adminâ€™s political attacks to undermine the census count would have lasting effects in our country. We cannot allow these attacks to continue & skew our results. I joined @SenBrianSchatz on a new call to @uscensusbureau to make sure they get this right: pic.twitter.com/FQyWZpfOXO
Itâ€™s with great sadness that I learned of the passing of AF Staff Sergeant Ronald Ouellette of Merrimack. I join all Granite Staters in paying tribute to him & offering condolences & support to his family. Our nation and state are eternally grateful for his service and sacrifice.
Under no circumstances should Congress recess before the election without passing a bill that protects the public from COVID-19 and provides relief to struggling NH families & communities. My statement as the U.S. approaches 200,000 COVID-19 deaths: pic.twitter.com/KN7PEd49uZ

The NH industrial base provides critical components to our submarine programs and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard maintains Virginia class subs. Boosting our military readiness & NHâ€™s role in support of our national defense will always be top priorities.

Every effort must be made to ensure missing U.S. service members are returned home, which is why I introduced a bipartisan bill that would bolster efforts to return the remains of POWs, MIAs & other vets so that families may find closure. Their sacrifices must never be forgotten.
POW/MIA Recognition Day is a solemn opportunity to honor and remember the nearly 82,000 American service members listed as missing in action, as well as those who faced harrowing circumstances as prisoners of war. pic.twitter.com/Sn91LOiqFI

Reports of abuse and neglect at an ICE detention facility - including allegations of hysterectomies being performed on immigrant women without their consent - are horrifying. There must be a full and thorough investigation!
