So should that beauty which you hold in leaseFind no determination; then you wereYourself again, after yourself's decease,When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,Which husbandry in honour might uphold,Against the stormy gusts of winter's dayAnd barren rage of death's eternal cold?
O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;And yet methinks I have astronomy,But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find:But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,And constant stars in them I read such artAs 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';Or else of thee this I prognosticate:'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'When I consider every thing that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment,That this huge stage presenteth nought but showsWhereon the stars in secret influence comment;When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,And wear their brave state out of memory;Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,Where wasteful Time debateth with decayTo change your day of youth to sullied night,And all in war with Time for love of you,
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.But wherefore do not you a mightier wayMake war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?And fortify your self in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?Now stand you on the top of happy hours,And many maiden gardens, yet unset,With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:So should the lines of life that life repair,Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
Can make you live your self in eyes of men.To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.
Where all the treasure of thy lusty daysTo say, within thine own deep-sunken eyesWere an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mineShall sum my count and make my old excuse,Proving his beauty by succession thine!This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her stillWhile comments of your praise, richly compil'd[Rehearse thy] character with golden quill
And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.I think good thoughts while others write good wordsAnd, like unletter'd clerk, still cry 'AmenTo every hymn that able spirit affords
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.Hearing you praised, I say "'Tis so, 'tis true,"And to the most of praise add something moreBut that is in my thought, whose love to you
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.Then others for the breath of words respectMe for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing
And like enough thou know'st thy estimateThe charter of thy worth gives thee releasingMy bonds in thee are all determinate.For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
And for that riches where is my deserving?The cause of this fair gift in me is wantingAnd so my patent back again is swerving.Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistakingSo thy great gift, upon misprision growingComes home again, on better judgment making.Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.That you were once unkind, befriends me nowAnd for that sorrow, which I then did feelNeeds must I under my transgression bow
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.For if you were by my unkindness shakenAs I by yours, y' have pass'd a hell of timeAnd I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.O, that our night of woe might have remember'dMy deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hitsAnd soon to you, as you to me, then tendered
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits!But that your trespass now becomes a feeMine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?To make me give the lie to my true sightAnd swear that brightness doth not grace the day?Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
That in the very refuse of thy deedsThere is such strength and warrantise of skillThat, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?O, though I love what others do abhorWith others thou shouldst not abhor my stateIf thy unworthiness rais'd love in me
More worthy I to be beloved of thee.The little Love-god lying once asleepLaid by his side his heart-inflaming brandWhilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden handThe fairest votary took up that fireWhich many legions of true hearts had warm'dAnd so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.This brand she quenched in a cool well byWhich from Love's fire took heat perpetualGrowing a bath and healthful remedy
If my dear love were but the child of state, It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd. No; it was builded far from accident; It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
Under the blow of thralled discontent, Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls: It fears not policy, that heretick, Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,
But all alone stands hugely politick, That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers. To this I witness call the fools of time, Which die for goodness, who have liv'd for crime.
Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long To speak of that which gives thee all thy might? Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light? Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem In gentle numbers time so idly spent; Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument. Rise, restive Muse, my love's sweet face survey, If Time have any wrinkle graven there; If any, be a satire to decay,
And make Time's spoils despised every where. Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life; So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.
Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth, [Why feed'st] these rebel powers that thee array? Why dost thou pine within, and suffer dearth, Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
Why so large cost, having so short a lease, Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? Shall worms, inheritors of this excess, Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss, And let that pine to aggravate thy store; Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross; Within be fed, without be rich no more:
So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men, And, Death once dead, there's no more dying then. Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
Is't not enough to torture me alone, But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be? Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken, And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken; A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd. Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward, But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard; Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol: And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee, Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.
Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery? Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true, And that your love taught it this alchymy, To make of monsters and things indigest
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, Creating every bad a perfect best, As fast as objects to his beams assemble? O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,
