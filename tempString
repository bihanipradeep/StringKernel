0,Just heard that Wacko John Bolton was talking of the fact that I discussed ‚Aulove letters from Kim Jong Un‚Au as though I viewed them as just that. Obviously, was just being sarcastic. Bolton was such a jerk!
0,Rochester N.Y., Brooklyn N.Y., Portland - All had bad nights, all weakly run by Radical Left Democrat Governors and Mayors! Get the picture?
0,Big Ten Football is looking really good, but may lose Michigan, Illinois, and Maryland because of those Governors‚Äô ridiculous lack of interest or political support. They will play without them?
0,The Democrats, together with the corrupt Fake News Media, have launched a massive Disinformation Campaign the likes of which has never been seen before. They will say anything, like their recent lies about me and the Military, and hope that it sticks... But #MAGA gets it!
0,The Democrats know that they are creating havoc on Election night. This is what they want. WE WILL WIN!
0,Steve Jobs would not be happy that his wife is wasting money he left her on a failing Radical Left Magazine that is run by a con man (Goldberg) and spews FAKE NEWS & HATE. Call her, write her, let her know how you feel!!!
0,Be smart Baltimore! You have been ripped off for years by the Democrats, & gotten nothing but poverty & crime. It will only get worse UNLESS YOU ELECT KIMBERLY KLACIK TO CONGRESS. She brings with her the power & ECONOMIC STRENGTH OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. She works sooo hard....
0,Wish I could join you, but totally focused on November 3rd. Thank you! #MAGA
1,It's not enough to just thank our essential workers ‚Äî we need to pay them. As president, I‚Äôll: - Raise the minimum wage to $15 - End the tipped minimum wage - End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities - Ensure everyone has strong benefits
1,For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions. It will end on my watch. I'll sign the PRO Act ‚Äî making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain ‚Äî and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.
1,Today, we honor the generations of union workers who fought for the rights, power, wages, and benefits that built and sustained the great American middle class. #LaborDay
1,We need to restore honor and decency to the White House.
1,Time and again, the president has refused to provide Puerto Rico with much-needed resources. He‚Äôs repeatedly insulted Puerto Ricans and this latest action is another example of his disrespect for the island. This ends when I‚Äôm elected president.
1,Donald Trump promised to be "the greatest jobs president God ever created." But in reality, he's on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered. American workers can't take four more years of his failed leadership.
1,We all want our schools to reopen ‚but we need to do it in a way that puts the health and safety of our students and educators first. Here's how @KamalaHarris and I will reopen our schools safely and effectively:
1,We know what President Trump thinks of our nation's veterans. Here is what they think of him.
1,Our nation is at an inflection point. @KamalaHarris and I sat down to discuss what brought us to this moment ‚Äî and how we move forward and build back better than before. Tune in to watch:
1,I urge President Trump to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is an important right ‚violence is wrong.. If he can say that, then he is unfit to be President.
